cat << EOF
amavisd-new is a high-performance interface between mailer (message 
transfer agent - MTA) and one or more content checkers: virus scanners, 
and/or SpamAssasin. It is written entirely in Perl. It talks to MTA 
via (E)SMTP or LMTP, or by using helper programs. Best with Postfix, 
works with Exim, sendmail/milter or with any MTA as a SMTP relay.
