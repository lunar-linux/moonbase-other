cat << EOF
Dovecot is an IMAP and POP3 server for Linux/UNIX-like systems,
written with security primarily in mind. Although it's written in C,
it uses several coding techniques to avoid most of the common pitfalls.

Dovecot can work with standard mbox and maildir formats and it's fully
compatible with UW-IMAP and Courier IMAP servers' implementation of
them as well as mail clients accessing the mailboxes directly. I have
also plans to support storing mails in SQL databases.

Dovecot is easy to set up and doesn't require special maintenance. Only
thing you need is to get the authentication working properly - if your
users are in /etc/passwd there's hardly anything you have to do.

Dovecot should be pretty fast. There are still some optimizations that
could be done, but I believe it already beats most other IMAP servers in
overall performance. This is mostly because of index files that Dovecot
maintains; instead of having to scan through all the data in mailbox,
Dovecot can get most of the wanted information from index with little
effort. Dovecot's indexes can scale to huge amount of messages per
mailbox with hardly any noticeable slowdown. I've tested only up to
367000 mails, but millions of messages should be no problem.

Dovecot takes very little memory. Most of it goes to mmap()ed index
and mailbox files, meaning that if operating system is low on memory,
it can simply drop those memory pages without having to store them in
swap. Connections are handled in separate processes, each one currently
using around 100kB of swappable memory. Some extensions like SORT and
THREAD will require more memory to work though.
