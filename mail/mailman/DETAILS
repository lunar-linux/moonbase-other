Mailman is software to help manage electronic mail discussion lists,
much like Majordomo or Smartmail. Mailman gives each mailing list
a unique web page and allows users to subscribe, unsubscribe, and
change their account options over the web. Even the list manager can
administer his or her list entirely via the web. Mailman has most of
the features that people want in a mailing list management system,
including built-in archiving, mail-to-news gateways, spam filters,
bounce detection, digest delivery, and so on.
