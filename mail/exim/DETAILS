Exim is a message transfer agent (MTA) developed at the University of Cambridge
for use on Unix systems connected to the Internet. It is freely available under
the terms of the GNU General Public Licence. In style it is similar to Smail 3,
but its facilities are more extensive, and in particular it has some defences
against mail bombs and unsolicited junk mail in the form of options for refusing
messages from particular hosts, networks, or senders.
