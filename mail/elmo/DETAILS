call it a Mail User Agent, but it offers much more than traditional MUA's.

A summary of its features:
  SMTP support (with authentication support)
  POP3 support
  a Bayesian mail filter!
  an address-book
  colors
  threads
  keymaps and hooks
  maildir and (partial) mbox support
  MIME support (including support for encoded headers)
  
Don't forget to launch elmoconf.pl to configure your box!
