cat << EOF
DRAC is a daemon that dynamically updates a relay authorization
map for sendmail. It provides a way to allow legitimate users 
to relay mail through an SMTP server, while still preventing 
others from using it as a spam relay. User's IP addresses 
are added to the map immediately after they have authenticated 
to the POP or IMAP server. By default, map entries expire after 
30 minutes, but can be renewed by additional authentication. 
Periodically checking mail on a POP server is sufficient to do 
this. The POP and SMTP servers can be on different hosts.

It can be used a number of SMTP clients, including sendmail 
and postfix.
