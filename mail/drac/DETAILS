cat << EOF
DRAC is a daemon that dynamically updates a relay authorization
map for sendmail. It provides a way to allow legitimate users
to relay mail through an SMTP server, while still preventing
others from using it as a spam relay. User's IP addresses
are added to the map immediately after they have authenticated
to the POP or IMAP server. By default, map entries expire after
30 minutes, but can be renewed by additional authentication.
Periodically checking mail on a POP server is sufficient to do
this. The POP and SMTP servers can be on different hosts.

It can be used a number of SMTP clients, including sendmail
and postfix.
