cat << EOF
Vipul's Razor is a distributed, collaborative, spam detection and 
filtering network. Through user contribution, Razor establishes a 
distributed and constantly updating catalogue of spam in propagation 
that is consulted by email clients to filter out known spam. 
Detection is done with statistical and randomized signatures that 
efficiently spot mutating spam content. User input is validated through 
reputation assignments based on consensus on report and revoke assertions 
which in turn is used for computing confidence values associated with 
individual signatures.
