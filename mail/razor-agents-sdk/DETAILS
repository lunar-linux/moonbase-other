cat << EOF
Vipul's Razor is a distributed, collaborative, spam detection and
filtering network. Through user contribution, Razor establishes a
distributed and constantly updating catalogue of spam in propagation
that is consulted by email clients to filter out known spam.
Detection is done with statistical and randomized signatures that
efficiently spot mutating spam content. User input is validated through
reputation assignments based on consensus on report and revoke assertions
which in turn is used for computing confidence values associated with
individual signatures.
