Courier-IMAP is a server that provides IMAP access to Maildirs.
The overall design goal of Courier-IMAP is to provide IMAP services
to maildirs with the least amount of resources. For this reason there
are many parameters that can be tuned during initial configuration and
at runtime. Unwanted components can be removed completely, and they
will not take up any resources.  Few sites need the ability to search
messages in twenty different character sets, so there's no need to
waste memory storing large character set mapping tables. Sites that
need multilingual searching and sorting abilities can selectively
choose which character set tables will be supported by the server,
individually. If SSL support is needed, it is available. If not,
the SSL wrapper does not have to be installed at all. If the server
does not have the sufficient resources to sort large folders, the
server-based IMAP sorting function can be turned off.
