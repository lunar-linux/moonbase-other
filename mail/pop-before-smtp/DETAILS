cat << EOF
The pop-before-smtp project is a simple daemon written in Perl, to
allow email relay control based on successful POP or IMAP logins. This
is the precise same job performed by DRAC. This daemon differs from
DRAC in its design target. DRAC is a client-server design, and
requires patching each pop or imap daemon that is going to
participate. Pop-before-smtp requires no mods to the other daemons,
and uses no client-server communication. So it's much, much simpler to
install and maintain, and it fails to address the needs of people with
separate pop/imap and smtp servers. Another system with some
similarities to DRAC is WHOSON.

pop-before-smtp watches your mail log file (e.g. /var/log/maillog) for
lines written by your POP/IMAP software (e.g. UW popd/imapd) that
indicate a successful login. When found, pop-before-smtp installs an
entry for the IP in an on-disk hash (DB) that is watched by your SMTP
software (e.g. Postfix). It then expires these entries when 30 minutes
have elapsed after the last POP/IMAP access from that IP.
