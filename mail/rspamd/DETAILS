cat << EOF
Rspamd is an advanced spam filtering system that allows evaluation of messages
by a number of rules including regular expressions, statistical analysis and
custom services such as URL black lists. Each message is analysed by rspamd and
given a spam score.
According to this spam score and the user's settings rspamd recommends an action
for the MTA to apply to the message- for example to pass, reject or add a header.
Rspamd is designed to process hundreds of messages per second simultaneously and
has a number of features available.
