cat << EOF
The mailx package installs the /bin/mail program, which is used to
send quick email messages (i.e., without opening up a full-featured
mail user agent). Mail is often used in shell scripts.

You should install mailx because of its quick email sending ability,
which is especially useful if you're planning on writing any shell
scripts.
