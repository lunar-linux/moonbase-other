cat << EOF
Sylpheed-Claws is a bleeding edge version of Sylpheed, which is a GTK+ based,
lightweight, and fast email client. Almost all commands are accessible with 
the keyboard. It also has many features such as multiple accounts, POP3/APOP 
support, thread display, and multipart MIME. One of Sylpheed's future goals
is to be fully internationalized. The messages are managed in the MH format,
so you'll be able to use it together with another mailer that uses the MH
format.
