Sender Policy Framework allows mail server administrators to reject
mail which has not been authorized by the originating mail admin. It
works by DNS lookups where the domain administrator tells the rest
of the internet that mail from his domains only originate from certain
servers. Other servers can then reject any mail from that domain if
it was not sent from those servers.

This module contains the library needed to run SPF filtering on your
MTA, so it is only usefull for mail server admins. You will need
certain configuration as well to make it work.
