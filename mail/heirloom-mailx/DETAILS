The Heirloom mailx package (formerly known as the Nail  package)
contains mailx, a command-line Mail User Agent derived from Berkeley
Mail which is intended to provide the functionality of the POSIX mailx
command with additional support for MIME messages, IMAP (including
caching), POP3, SMTP, S/MIME, message threading/sorting, scoring,
and filtering. Heirloom mailx is especially useful for writing scripts
and batch processing.
