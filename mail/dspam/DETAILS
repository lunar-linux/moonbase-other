DSPAM is a scalable and open-source content-based spam filter designed
for multi-user enterprise systems. On a properly configured system, many
users experience results between 99.5% - 99.95%, or one error for every
200 to 2000 messages. DSPAM supports many different MTAs and can also be
deployed as a stand-alone SMTP appliance.
