SpamAssassin is a mail filter to identify spam.
Using its rule base, it uses a wide range of heuristic tests on mail headers 
and body text to identify "spam", also known as unsolicited commercial email. 
The spam-identification tactics used include:
* header analysis: spammers use a number of tricks to mask their identities, 
  fool you into thinking they've sent a valid mail, or fool you into thinking 
  you must have subscribed at some stage. SpamAssassin tries to spot these.
* text analysis: again, spam mails often have a characteristic style (to put 
  it politely), and some characteristic disclaimers and CYA text. SpamAssassin 
  can spot these, too.
* blacklists: SpamAssassin supports many useful existing blacklists, such as 
  mail-abuse.org, ordb.org or others.
* Razor: Vipul's Razor is a collaborative spam-tracking database, which works 
  by taking a signature of spam messages. Since spam typically operates by 
  sending an identical message to hundreds of people, Razor short-circuits this 
  by allowing the first person to receive a spam to add it to the database -- 
  at which point everyone else will automatically block it.
Once identified, the mail can then be optionally tagged as spam for later 
filtering using the user's own mail user-agent application.
SpamAssassin requires very little configuration; you do not need to continually 
update it with details of your mail accounts, mailing list memberships, etc. 
It accomplishes filtering without this knowledge, as much as possible.
The distribution provides a command line tool to perform filtering, along with 
Mail::SpamAssassin, a set of perl modules which implement a Mail::Audit plugin, 
allowing SpamAssassin to be used in a Mail::Audit filter, or (possibly at some 
point) in a spam-protection proxy POP/IMAP server.
