Sender Policy Framework allows mail server administrators to reject
mail which has not been authorized by the originating mail admin. It
works by DNS lookups where the domain administrator tells the rest
of the internet that mail from his domains only originate from certain
servers. Other servers can then reject any mail from that domain if
it was not sent from those servers.

this module installs the postfix plugin to make postfix use libspf2.
