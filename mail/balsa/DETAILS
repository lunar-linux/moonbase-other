Balsa is a GNOME email client. It supports mbox, maildir, and mh local 
mailboxes, and IMAP4 and POP3 remote mailboxes. You can send mail via 
sendmail or SMTP. Optional multithreading support allows for non-instrusive 
retrieval and sending of mail. A finished GUI similar to that of Eudora 
lets you view images inline, save message parts, view headers, add 
attachments, move messages, print messages, and just about anything you 
would expect in a robust mail client.
