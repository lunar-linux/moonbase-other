Dbmail is the name of a group of programs that enable the possiblilty of
storing and retrieving mail messages from a database. Currently MySQL, 
PostgreSQL and SQLite can be used as database backends.
Why is it useful?
Well, for me it's useful because a number of reasons. 
- it enables me to create mailboxes without the need of system users.
- mail is more effeciently stored and therefore it can
  be inserted an retrieved much faster than any regular system 
  (DBMail is currently able to retrieve aprox. 250 mail messages per 
  second)
- it's more expandable. A database is much easier to access than
  a flat file or a Maildir. We don't need to parse first.
- In my case, i can easily link a mailbox to a certain client
  which enables me to let the client maintaining his/her own mailboxes
  without me needing to technically support it.
- It's scalable. You can run the dbmail programs on different servers
  talking to the same database(cluster).
- It is more secure. There's no need to maintain system users or write 
  to the filesystem. All this is done through the database.
