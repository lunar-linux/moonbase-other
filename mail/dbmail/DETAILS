DBMail is a collection of programs that enables email to be
stored in and retrieved from a database. 
Why is it usefull?
Well, for me it's usefull because a number of reasons. 
- it enables me to create mailboxes without the need of system users.
- mail is more effeciently stored and therefore it can
  be inserted an retrieved much faster dan any regular system 
  (DBMail is currently able to retrieve aprox. 250 mail messages per 
  second)
- it's more expandable. A database is much easier to access than
  a flat file or a Maildir. We don't need to parse first.
- In my case, i can easily link a mailbox to a certain client
  which enables me to let the client maintaining his/her own mailboxes
  without me needing to technically support it.
- It's scalable. You can run the dbmail programs on different servers
  talking to the same database(cluster).
- It is more secure. There's no need to maintain system users or write 
  to the filesystem. All this is done through the database.
