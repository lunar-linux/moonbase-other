cat << EOF
Vipul's Razor is a distributed, collaborative, spam detection and 
filtering network.  Through user contribution, Razor establishes a
distributed and constantly updating catalog of spam in propagation
that is consulted by email clients to filter out known spam. 
Detection is done with statistical and randomized signatures that 
efficiently spot mutating spam content.  User input is validated 
through reputation assignments based on consensus on report and revoke
assertions which in turn is used for computing confidence values 
associated with individual signatures.
