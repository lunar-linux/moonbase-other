cat << EOF
fdm (fetch and deliver mail) is a simple, lightweight replacement for
mail fetching, filtering, and delivery programs such as fetchmail and
procmail. It can fetch using POP3, POP3S, IMAP, IMAPS, or stdin, and
deliver to a pipe, file, maildir, mbox, or SMTP server, based on a set
of regexps. It can be used for both single user and multiuser setups,
and is designed with privilege separation when running as root.
