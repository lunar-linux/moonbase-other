Sendmail is the de-facto standard SMTP server for relaying e-mail
around the world. Sendmail is a very complex server that allows great
flexibility but at the cost of complexity. It's installation is lengthy
and configuration can be a nightmare, be warned. Fortunately it is the
most reliable mailserver around so almost any major e-mail provider
runs this.
