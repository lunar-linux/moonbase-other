cat << EOF
This program is a minimal SMTP client that takes an email message body
and passes it on to a SMTP server (default is the MTA on the local
host). Since it is completely self-supporting, it is especially suitable
for use in restricted environments.
It can be used to handle private port email with spamassassin and
postfix.
