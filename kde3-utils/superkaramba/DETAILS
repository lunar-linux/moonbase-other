Theme writers create themes, or text files that define their widget. Then, 
they can optionally add python scripting to make their widget interactive. 
Here are just some examples of the things that can be done: 
  * Display system information such as CPU Usage, MP3 playing, etc.
  * Create cool custom toolbars that work any way imaginable.
  * Create little games or virtual pets that live on your desktop.
  * Display information from the internet, such as weather and headlines.
The possibilities really are endless!
