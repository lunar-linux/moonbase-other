cat << EOF
Ksetiwatch is a monitoring tool for the SETI@home distributed computing 
project, which searches for signals of extraterrestrial life. Ksetiwatch is 
written for the K Desktop Environment. It circumvents the most annoying 
feature of text-based SETI@home clients: the lack of information about the 
state of the client(s), the progress of data crunching, the work units 
currently being processed, and about already completed work units.
