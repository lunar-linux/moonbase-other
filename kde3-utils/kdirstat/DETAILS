cat << EOF
KDirStat (for KDE Directory Statistics) is a small utility program that sums
up disk usage for direcory trees - very much like the Unix 'du' command. But
unlike 'du', it tries to do that in a structured, comprehensive manner. It 
tries to provide the information you are looking for - exactly where all your 
disk space has gone.
