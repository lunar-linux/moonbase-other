The Xfce Foundation Classes is a set of integrated C++ classes for
developing Xfce applications on UNIX-like operating systems such as
Linux. The classes combine the power of GTK+ and the power of C++
into a state-of-the-art application development framework for the Xfce
Desktop Environment. The classes judiciously use C++ language features
to avoid layering on too much extra C++ complexity. The API is easy to
understand and use, and should feel immediately familiar to most GTK+
programmers. The Xfce Foundation Classes is part of the Xfce project,
and like Xfce it's lightweight, fast and easy to use.
