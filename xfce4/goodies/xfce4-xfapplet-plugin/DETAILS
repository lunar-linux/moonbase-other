The XfApplet Plugin is a plugin for the Xfce 4 Panel which allows
one to use applets designed for the Gnome Panel inside the Xfce
Panel. You can think of XfApplet as a tiny Gnome Panel that lives
inside the Xfce Panel and allows you to show the same applets that
the Gnome Panel is capable of showing.

Warning: requires a lot of GNOME to be installed !
