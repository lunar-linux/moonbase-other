StarDict is a Cross-Platform and international dictionary written in Gtk2.
It has powerful features such as "Glob-style pattern matching",
"Scan selection word," "Fuzzy query," etc.

No dictionaries are included in this module. See stardict-gcide module for
an English dictionary example.

A large selection of dictionaries is available for downloading in the StarDict
format. Many of the available dictionaries are for use in one language to another
language.
