Conglomerate is a project to create a complete structured information
authoring, management, archival, revision control and transformation
system. Conglomerate uses XML semantics and powerful graphical editing,
coupled with a centralised storage model and a flexible transformation
language to create an environment which is easy to use, produces
high-quality structured output, and lets the user target several
output media with a single source document.
