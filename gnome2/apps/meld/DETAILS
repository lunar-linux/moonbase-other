cat << EOF
Meld is a visual diff and merge tool. It integrates especially well 
with CVS. The diff viewer lets you edit files in place (diffs update 
dynamically), and a middle column shows detailed changes and allows 
merges. The margins show location of changes for easy navigation, and 
it also features a tabbed interface that allows you to open many diffs 
at once.
