cat << EOF
Soup is a SOAP (Simple Object Access Protocol) implementation in C.
It provides an queued asynchronous callback-based mechanism for sending and
servicing SOAP requests, and a WSDL (Web Service Definition Language) to C
compiler which generates client stubs and server skeletons for easily calling
and implementing SOAP methods.
