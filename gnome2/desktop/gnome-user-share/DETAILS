gnome-user-share is a session service that exports the contents of
the Public folder in your home directory so that they can easily be
accessed from other computers on the same local network.

gnome user-share uses a WebDAV server to share the Public folder,
and advertises the share on the local network using mDNS.

Additionally, gnome-user-share can make the shared files available
via ObexFTP over BlueTooth, and receive files that are sent to
your computer via BlueTooth via ObexPush.
