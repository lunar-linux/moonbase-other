GtkHTML is a HTML rendering/editing library.  It is not designed to be
the ultimate HTML browser/editor; instead, it is designed to be easily
embedded into applications that require lightweight HTML functionality.

NOTE: This is a backwards compatible version of gtkhtml3 and is specifically
for gnucash-2.0.5, which is broken with gtkhtml >= 3.14.x. evolution needs
gtkhmtl >= 3.14.x !!!
