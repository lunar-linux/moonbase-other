cat << EOF
The librsvg library is a lightweight library for parsing and
rendering vector-graphic files in SVG format (like the ones made by
sodipodi).  It also includes functions that render anti-aliased fonts
using freetype, including caching of glyphs. It's used by Nautilus
for drawing vector icons and anti-aliased type.
