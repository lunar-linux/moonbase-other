Dasher is an information-efficient text-entry interface, driven by
natural continuous pointing gestures. Dasher is a competitive text-
entry system wherever a full-size keyboard cannot be used - for 
example:
    * on a palmtop computer;
    * on a wearable computer;
    * when operating a computer one-handed, by joystick, touchscreen, 
      trackball, or mouse;
    * when operating a computer with zero hands (i.e., by head-mouse 
      or by eyetracker).
The eyetracking version of Dasher allows an experienced user to write
text as fast as normal handwriting - 25 words per minute; using a mouse,
experienced users can write at 39 words per minute.
