  This is a xscreensaver hack, a wm (window maker) applet and gnome
  applet too, that gives you an aquarium with some randomly selected
  fish that live there. Well, to tell you the truth, you can get some
  other sea animals in your aquarium too.
  Some other features this program gives you, except for the part that
  it gives you an aquarium with fishes that takes care of itself, no
  feeding, no cleaning and so on, is that the temperature scale on the
  right side shows the CPU load. It can also be configurated to display
  the time and show the status of numlock, capslock and scrollock. The
  fishes are done by Jim Toomey, the author of the "Sherman's Lagoon"
  comics.
