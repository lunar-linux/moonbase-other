Libgda is a (relatively small) database access library:

  * a wrapper line ODBC but with more features to access several
    database engines
  * a meta data extractor (to know all about database objects in
    a common way)
  * comes with an SQL console application (line mysql, psql or
    sqlite3 consoles)
  * relies on GLib, coded in C, its API is easy to use
  * at the moment supports SQLite, MySQL, PostgreSQL, MSAccess
    and Bdb, work is in progress for other database types (such
    as Firebird and Oracle) and to wrap JDBC for wider usage
  * LGPL licensed
