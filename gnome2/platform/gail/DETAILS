cat << EOF
gail (GNOME Accessibility Implementation Library) implements ATK
interfaces for GTK+-2 widgets which are dynamically loadable at
runtime by a GTK+-2 application.  Once loaded, those parts of an
application that use standard GTK+-2 widgets will have a basic level
of accessibility features, without the need to modify the application
at all.
