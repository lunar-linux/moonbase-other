cat << EOF
Libxslt is a C library for GNOME which allows developers to work with 
XSLT. It is based on libxml for XML parsing, tree manipulation, and 
XPath support. It is written in plain C, making as few assumptions as 
possible, and sticking closely to ANSI C/POSIX for easy embedding. 
Though not designed primarily with performances in mind, libxslt seems 
to be a relatively fast processor.
