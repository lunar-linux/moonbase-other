cat << EOF
Elogind is the systemd project's "logind", extracted out to be a standalone
daemon. It integrates with PAM to know the set of users that are logged in to a
system and whether they are logged in graphically, on the console, or remotely.
Elogind exposes this information via the standard org.freedesktop.login1 D-Bus
interface, as well as through the file system using systemd's standard
/run/systemd layout.
Elogind also provides "libelogind", which is a subset of the facilities offered
by "libsystemd". There is a "libelogind.pc" pkg-config file as well.
