Licq includes all the basic features of ICQ, like sending/receiving
messages, chat, file transfer, contact list with pixmaps and user
status, basic/extended user info, adding/editing users from within
the GUI, user history, user groups, and new user registration. All
commands and information are available through a simple and
convenient tab dialog. Licq also has a completely configurable user
interface with Skin and Icon pack support. It is written in C++ and
comes with a GUI plugin using the Qt widget set. Other plugins are
also available.
