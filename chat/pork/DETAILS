pork is an ncurses-based AOL instant messenger client. It uses the
OSCAR protocol to access AIM. Pork features Perl scripting; an online
help system; the ability to configure nearly all aspects of the
program's look-and-feel; and alias system; and a powerful key binding
system. It also supports being logged in with more than one screen
name at the same time.
