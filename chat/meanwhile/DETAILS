The Meanwhile Project is an open implementation of the Lotus Sametime
Community Client protocol.

The heart of the Meanwhile Project is the Meanwhile library, providing
the basic Lotus Sametime session functionality along with the core
services; Presence Awareness, Instant Messaging, Multi-user
Conferencing, Preferences Storage, Identity Resolution, and File
Transfer.  This extensible client interface allows additional services
to be added to a session at runtime, allowing for simple integration
of future service handlers such as the user directory and whiteboard
and screen-sharing.
