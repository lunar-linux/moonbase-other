cat << EOF
ReAIM is a compact transparent proxy designed to be run on or behind a
Linux IPTables based firewall. When run behind a simple address-translating
firewall, the current AIM client software does not allow direct-connections
between users to work. AIM requires direct-connections for file and image
transfers.
