dircproxy is an IRC proxy server ("bouncer") designed for people who use
IRC from lots of different workstations or clients, but wish to remain
connected and see what they missed while they were away. You connect to
IRC through dircproxy, and it keeps you connected to the server, even
after you detach your client from it. While you're detached, it logs
channel and private messages as well as important events, and when you
reattach it'll let you know what you missed.
