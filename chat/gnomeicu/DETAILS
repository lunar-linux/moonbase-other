GnomeICU is a clone of Mirabilis' popular ICQ written with GTK.
The original source was taken from Matt Smith's mICQ.  This is ment as
a replacement for the JavaICQ, which is slow and buggy.  If you would
like to contribute, please contact Jeremy Wise ( jwise@pathwaynet.com ).

the ICQ protocol and mailing list.
