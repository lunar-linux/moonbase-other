cat << EOF
Xaric is a UNIX irc client similer to BitchX or ircII.
I would impress you with a list of features, but since
it has no impressive features (and lacks a few important
ones) that probably is not a good idea. The whole reason
for Xaric was to remove all of the bogus, broken crap and
silly features from BitchX and have a nice colorful client.
