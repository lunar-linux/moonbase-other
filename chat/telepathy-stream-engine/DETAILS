cat << EOF
Stream Engine is a Telepathy client that uses Farsight and GStreamer to handle
media streaming channels. It's used as a background process by other Telepathy
clients, rather than presenting any user interface of its own.

Telepathy is a D-Bus framework for unifying real time communication,
including instant messaging, voice calls and video calls. It abstracts
differences between protocols to provide a unified interface for
applications.
