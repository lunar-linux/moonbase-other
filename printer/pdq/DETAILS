pdq is a direct replacement of lpr. Adding and configuring printers
does not require root privilege. Jobs can be monitored through
completion, job status can be checked *after* completion. Users can
create custom command line options to set features such as tray
selection, color mode, and print quality options. xpdq provides a
graphical GTK based interface to simplify printer and option selection,
and provides a wizard for printer installation.
