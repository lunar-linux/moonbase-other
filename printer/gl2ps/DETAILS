GL2PS is a C library providing high quality vector output for any OpenGL
application. The main difference between GL2PS and other similar libraries (see
section 7) is the use of sorting algorithms capable of handling intersecting
and stretched polygons, as well as non manifold objects. GL2PS provides advanced
smooth shading and text rendering, culling of invisible primitives, mixed
vector/bitmap output, and much more...

GL2PS can currently create PostScript (PS), Encapsulated PostScript (EPS),
Portable Document Format (PDF) and Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG) files, as well
as LATEX files for the text fragments. GL2PS also provides limited, experimental
support for Portable LaTeX Graphics (PGF). Adding new vector output formats
should be relatively easy; you can also use the excellent pstoedit program to
transform the PostScript files generated by GL2PS into many other vector formats
such as xfig, cgm, wmf, etc.
