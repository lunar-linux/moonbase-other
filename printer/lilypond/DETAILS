The inspiration for LilyPond came when two befriended musicians got annoyed
with the bland and boring look of computer print-outs. Every musician
prefers reading beautiful music, so couldn't we programmers solve that
printing problem?

LilyPond just does that: it prints music in the best traditions of classical
engraving with minimum fuss. Don't waste time on tuning spacing, moving
around symbols, or shaping slurs. Impress friends and colleagues with sharp
sheet music!
