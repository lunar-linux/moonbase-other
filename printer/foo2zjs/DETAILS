           SHORT="a linux printer driver for ZjStream protocol."

cat << EOF
foo2zjs is an open source printer driver for printers that use the Zenographics
ZjStream wire protocol for their print data, such as the Minolta/QMS magicolor 
2300 DL or Konica Minolta magicolor 2430 DL. These printers are often 
erroneously referred to as winprinters or GDI printers. However, Microsoft GDI 
only mandates the API between an application and the printer driver, not the 
protocol on the wire between the printer driver and the printer. In fact, 
ZjStream printers are raster printers which happen to use a very efficient 
wire protocol which was developed by Zenographics and licensed by most major 
printer manufacturers for at least some of their product lines. ZjStream is 
just one of many wire protocols that are in use today, such as Postscript, 
PCL, Epson, etc.
