cat << EOF
CUPS provides a portable printing layer for UNIX(r)-based operating
systems. It has been developed to promote a standard printing solution
for all UNIX vendors and users. CUPS provides the System V and Berkeley
commandline interfaces, uses the Internet Printing Protocol ("IPP") as
the basis for managing print jobs and queues, supports (with reduced
functionality) the Line Printer Daemon ("LPD"), Server Message Block
("SMB"), and AppSocket (a.k.a. JetDirect) protocols, and adds network
printer browsing and PostScript Printer Description ("PPD")-based
printing options to support real-world printing under UNIX. CUPS also
includes a customized version of GNU Ghostscript and an image file RIP
that are used to support non-PostScript printers. Sample drivers for HP
and EPSON printers are included that use these filters.
