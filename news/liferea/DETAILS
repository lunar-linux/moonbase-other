cat << EOF
Liferea is a news aggregator for RSS/RDF feeds which also supports
CDF channels, Atom/Echo/PIE feeds and OCS or OPML directories. The
problem with FeedReader: for now its only available for Windows.
There are some projects for GNU/Linux, but no solution for GTK/GNOME,
which does not require Python or Perl. Liferea tries to fill this gap.
Liferea is an abbreviation for Linux Feed Reader.
