cg is a semi-automatic newsgroup binary downloader.  It assembles parts based on subject headers and then offers them in an editor for the user to choose which files he really wants

It supports decoding data in the following formats:
   uuencode (both single- and multi-posting binaries)
   MIME (multipart/mixed, message/partial, base64,
         quoted printable, x-uuencode)
   yEnc

Start it with 'cg somenewsgroup'; 'cg -h' offers a short help, should you need it.
