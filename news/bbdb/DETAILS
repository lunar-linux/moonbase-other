The Insidious Big Brother Database is a contact management tool for use
with Emacs.  It is tightly integrated with several mail and news readers
for Emacs which allows it to create database entries directly from mail
and news messages.  This version (for Lunar's moonbase) is
integrated with Gnus, and depends on that package.
