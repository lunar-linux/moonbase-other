cat << EOF
Shellcaster is a terminal-based podcast manager, built in Rust. It provides a
terminal UI (i.e., ncurses) to allow users to subscribe to podcast feeds, and
sync feeds to check for new episodes. Episodes may be downloaded locally,
played (with an external media player, at least for now), and marked as played/
unplayed. Keybindings and other options are configurable via a config file.
