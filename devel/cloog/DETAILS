cat << EOF
CLooG is a free software and library to generate code for
scanning Z-polyhedra. That is, it finds a code (e.g. in C,
FORTRAN...) that reaches each integral point of one or more
parameterized polyhedra. CLooG has been originally written to solve
the code generation problem for optimizing compilers based on the
polytope model. Nevertheless it is used now in various area e.g. to
build control automata for high-level synthesis or to find the best
polynomial approximation of a function. CLooG may help in any situation
where scanning polyhedra matters. While the user has full control on
generated code quality, CLooG is designed to avoid control overhead
and to produce a very effective code.
