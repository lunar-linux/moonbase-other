cat << EOF
Tree-sitter is a parser generator tool and an incremental parsing library. It
can build a concrete syntax tree for a source file and efficiently update the
syntax tree as the source file is edited. Tree-sitter aims to be:
 - General enough to parse any programming language
 - Fast enough to parse on every keystroke in a text editor
 - Robust enough to provide useful results even in the presence of syntax errors
 - Dependency-free so that the runtime library (which is written in pure C) can
   be embedded in any application.
