cat << EOF
Kiwi consists of a set of classes and wrappers for PyGTK that were
developed to provide a sort of framework for applications.  Fully
object-oriented, and roughly Smalltalk's MVC, Kiwi provides a simple,
practical way to build forms, windows, and widgets that transparently
access and display your object data.  Kiwi is inspired by Allen 
Holub's Visual Proxy.
