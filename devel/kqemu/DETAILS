cat << EOF
The QEMU Accelerator Module increases the speed of QEMU when a PC is emulated
on a PC. It runs most of the target application code directly on the host
processor to achieve near native performance. It is very useful when you want
to run another Operating System (for example Windows) on a Linux desktop.
