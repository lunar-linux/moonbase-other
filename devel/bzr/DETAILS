cat << EOF
Bazaar-NG (or bzr) is a project of Canonical to develop an open source
distributed version control system that is powerful, friendly, and scalable.

  Written in Python (but nevertheless fast and easy to install.)
  Runs on Linux, Windows and Mac OS X, or any system with a Python interpreter.
    (Primarily tested on Ubuntu.)
  Free software, released under the GNU GPL.
  Designed to play well with others: can be called by IDEs, editors, web tools,
    GUIs, etc through either a Python API or a shell interface, and possibly a
    C interface in the future. Can support workflow/process tools built on top.
  The user interface is simple and familiar to people with experience from CVS
    or Subversion: add, mv, diff, status, commit, log, merge, etc all do what
    you would expect.
  Offers a choice between centralized and decentralized work within a single
    project: when in the office, you can work on a shared central branch. For
    experimental changes or offline work you can make a branch on your laptop
    and merge back in later.
  Preserves history; any previous revision can be recreated. History can be
    GPG-signed to protect against man-in-the-middle attacks, bad mirrors,
    server intrusion or data corruption.
  Just one .bzr directory at the top of the tree; it doesn't clutter the tree
    or get in your face. No weird ++file--names--0.
  Tracks file and directory renames and merges across them.
  Powerful Python plugin system for adding new commands, protocols, formats, or
    site policy.
