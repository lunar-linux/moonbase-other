cat << EOF
Xapian is an Open Source Search Engine Library, released under the GPL. It's 
written in C++, with bindings to allow use from Perl, Python, PHP, Java, 
Tcl, C#, Ruby and Lua (so far!)

Xapian is a highly adaptable toolkit which allows developers to easily add 
advanced indexing and search facilities to their own applications. It 
supports the Probabilistic Information Retrieval model and also supports a 
rich set of boolean query operators.
