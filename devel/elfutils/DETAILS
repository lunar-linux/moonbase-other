Elfutils is a collection of utilities, including ld (a linker), nm (for 
listing symbols from object files), size (for listing the section sizes 
of an object or archive file), strip (for discarding symbols), readelf 
(to see the raw ELF file structures), and elflint (to check for 
well-formed ELF files).  Also included are numerous helper libraries 
which implement DWARF, ELF, and machine-specific ELF handling.
