pmount  ("policy mount") is a wrapper around the standard mount program
which permits normal users to mount removable devices without a  match-
ing /etc/fstab entry.
pmount also supports encrypted devices which use dm-crypt and have LUKS
metadata. If a LUKS-capable cryptsetup is installed, pmount will use it
to  decrypt  the  device  first and mount the mapped unencrypted device
instead.
