Tig is a git repository browser that additionally can act as a pager for output
from various git commands. When browsing repositories, it uses the underlying
git commands to present the user with various views, such as summarized
revision log and showing the commit with the log message, diffstat, and the
diff. Using it as a pager, it will display input from stdin and colorize it.
