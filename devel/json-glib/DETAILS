Many high-level languages already provide native modules for parsing, generating
and manipulating JSON data streams. JSON-GLib is a C library based on GLib and
released under the terms of the GNU Lesser General Public License version 2.1.
It provides a parser and a generator GObject classes and various wrappers for
the complex data types employed by JSON, such as arrays and objects.

JSON-GLib uses GLib native data types and the generic value container GValue for
ease of development. It also provides integration with the GObject classes for
direct serialization into, and deserialization from, JSON data streams.
