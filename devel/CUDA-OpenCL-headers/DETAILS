           SHORT="Nvidia CUDA and OpenCL headers extracted from SDK"
cat << EOF
Nvidia since 260 driver release stopped providing header files.
Now CUDA headers are only present in CUDA Toolkit which weights
84.2 MB. From this package we need only some header files which
weights 37 KB. So to avoid big unnecessary downloads of cuda toolkit
I extracted them to separate archive.

If you are Lunar developer and want to update this package do it
the following way:
0. OpenCL headers are present here:
http://www.khronos.org/registry/cl
1. Go to http://developer.nvidia.com/object/cuda_download.html
2. Choose Linux
3. Choose one of "CUDA Toolkit for " - no matter what Linux
   distribution and if it is 32 or 64 bit.
   I checked that all of them have the same header files.
4. Download chosen CUDA Toolkit.
5. Unpack it:
./cudatoolkit_3.2.16_linux_32_rhel5.5.run --target rhel55 --noexec --keep
6. All files are in include subdir.
6. Replace files in this module's archive with those updated.
Do not add any new header files. Just replace those that are already present.
cudatoolkit provides many header files which are not needed outside toolkit.
