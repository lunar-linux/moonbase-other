           SHORT="Nvidia CUDA and OpenCL headers extracted from SDK"

cat << EOF
Nvidia since 260 driver release stopped providing header files.
Now CUDA and OpenCL headers are only present in CUDA Toolkit
which wegihts 84.2 MB. From this package we need only some
header files which weights 50 KB. So to avoid big unnecessary
downloads of cuda toolkit I extracted them to separate archive.

If you are Lunar developer and want to update this package do it
the following way:
1. Go to http://developer.nvidia.com/object/cuda_download.html
2. Choose Linux
3. Choose one of "CUDA Toolkit for " - no matter what Linux
   distribution and if it is 32 or 64 bit.
   I checked that all of them have the same header files.
4. Download chosen CUDA Toolkit.
5. Unpack it:
./cudatoolkit_3.2.9_linux_32_rhel5.5.run --target rhel55 --noexec --keep
6. All files are in include subdir.
6. Replace files in this module's archive with those updated.
Do not add any new header files. Just replace those that are already present.
cudatoolkit provides many header files which are not needed outside toolkit.
