cat << EOF
The debug memory allocation or dmalloc library has been designed as a
drop in replacement for the system's malloc, realloc, calloc, free and
other memory management routines while providing powerful debugging
facilities configurable at runtime. These facilities include such things
as memory-leak tracking, fence-post write detection, file/line number
reporting, and general logging of statistics.
