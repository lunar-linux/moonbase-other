cat << EOF
ltrace is a debugging program which runs a specified command until it exits. 
While the command is executing, ltrace intercepts and records the dynamic 
library calls which are called by the executed process and the signals 
received by that process. It can also intercept and print the system calls 
executed by the program. The program to be traced need not be recompiled for 
this, so you can use it on binaries for which you don't have the source handy. 
You should install ltrace if you need a sysadmin tool for tracking the 
execution of processes.
