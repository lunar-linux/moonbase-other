cat << EOF
pkg-config is a system for managing library compile/link flags that
works with automake and autoconf. It replaces the ubiquitous *-config
scripts you may have seen with a single tool. There's nothing
desktop-specific or desktop-related about pkg-config, despite it being
on freedesktop.org.
NOTE: as of > pkgconfig-0.18, pkgconfig was renamed to pkg-config. So
rather than renaming this module all over moonbase, I decided to keep
the module as named pkgconfig, and adjusted the SOURCE and
SOURCE_DIRECTORY accordingly.
