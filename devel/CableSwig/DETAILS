CableSwig is used to create interfaces (i.e. "wrappers") to interpreted languages
such as Tcl and Python. It was created to produce wrappers for ITK because the 
toolkit uses C++ structures that SWIG cannot parse (deeply nested template 
instantiations). CableSwig is a combination tool that uses  GCC_XML as the c++ 
parser. The input files are  Cable style input files. The XML produced from the 
Cable/GCC_XML input files are then parsed and feed into a modified version of 
SWIG. 

SWIG is a software development tool that connects programs written in C and C++ 
with a variety of high-level programming languages. It is used to generate the 
language bindings to the target language. Currently, Tcl and Python are supported.
