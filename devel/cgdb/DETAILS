cat << EOF
cgdb is a lightweight curses (terminal-based) interface to the GNU Debugger
(GDB). In addition to the standard gdb console, cgdb provides a split screen
view that displays the source code as it executes. The keyboard interface is
modeled after vim, so vim users should feel at home using cgdb.
