CGDB is a curses-based interface to the GNU Debugger (GDB). 
The goal of CGDB is to be lightweight and responsive; not encumbered 
with unnecessary features. The interface is designed to deliver the 
familiar GDB text interface, with a split screen showing the source 
as it executes. The UI is modeled on the classic Unix text editor, vi. 
Those familiar with vi should feel right at home using CGDB.
