cat << EOF
The Boehm-Demers-Weiser conservative garbage collector can be used as a 
garbage collecting replacement for C malloc or C++ new. It is also used 
by a number of programming language implementations that use C as 
intermediate code. Alternatively, it may be used as a leak detector for 
C or C++ programs. A slightly older version of the garbage collector is 
also included as part of the GNU compiler (gcc) distribution.
