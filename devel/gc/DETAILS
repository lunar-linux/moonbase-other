cat << EOF
The Boehm-Demers-Weiser conservative garbage collector can be used as a
garbage collecting replacement for C malloc or C++ new. It is also used
by a number of programming language implementations that use C as
intermediate code. Alternatively, it may be used as a leak detector for
C or C++ programs. A slightly older version of the garbage collector is
also included as part of the GNU compiler (gcc) distribution.
