cat << EOF
GNU DDD is a graphical front-end for command-line debuggers such as 
GDB, DBX, WDB, Ladebug, JDB, XDB, the Perl debugger, the bash 
debugger, or the Python debugger.  Besides ``usual'' front-end 
features such as viewing source texts, DDD has become famous through
its interactive graphical data display, where data structures are
displayed as graphs.
