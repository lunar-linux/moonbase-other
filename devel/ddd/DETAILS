GNU DDD is a graphical front-end for command-line debuggers such as GDB, DBX, 
WDB, Ladebug, JDB, XDB, the Perl debugger, or the Python debugger. Besides 
``usual'' front-end features such as viewing source texts, DDD has become 
famous through its interactive graphical data display, where data structures 
are displayed as graphs.
