cat << EOF
zshdb is gdb-like debugger for zsh scripts. It started as a port of my bash
debugger bashdb so the commands used in both are similar.
The command syntax generally follows that of the trepanning debuggers and, more
generally, GNU debugger gdb. Therefore knowledge gained by learning this is
transferable to those debuggers and vice versa.
