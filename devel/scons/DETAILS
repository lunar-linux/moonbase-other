SCons is a software construction tool (build tool substitute for Make)
implemented in Python. It features a modular build engine that can be 
embedded in other software. SCons configuration files are Python scripts 
that call the build engine API. It can scan files to detect dependencies 
automatically and maintain a global view of all dependencies in a build 
tree, and uses MD5 signatures to detect changed file contents reliably. 
Timestamps can be used if you prefer. SCons also supports parallel builds 
and is easily extensible through user-defined builder and scanner objects.
