cat << EOF
GOB is a preprocessor for making GTK+ objects with inline C code so that generated files are not editted. Syntax is inspired by java and yacc or lex. The implementation is intentionaly kept simple, and no C actual code parsing is done.

Reasons:

    * C is a perfect (well mostly) language, no need for another language
    * Writing a fully featured GTK+ object is a hassle
    * GTK+ has little typesafety, GOB improves on it.
    * Need for a generator that doesn't require changes to generated code
    * I like how Java writes method code directly into the class definition.
