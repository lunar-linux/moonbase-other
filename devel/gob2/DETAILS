           SHORT="A preprocessor for making GObjects with inline C code"

cat << EOF
GOB2 is a preprocessor for making GObjects with inline C code so that
generated files are not edited.  Syntax is inspired by Java and Yacc 
or Lex.  The implementation is intentionally kept simple, and no C 
actual code parsing is done.

Reasons:
 * C is a perfect (well mostly) language, no need for another language
 * Writing a fully featured GObject is a hassle
 * GObject has little type safety, GOB improves on it
 * Need for a generator that doesn't require changes to generated code
 * I like how Java writes method code directly into the class 
   definition
