cat << EOF
GOB2 is a preprocessor for making GObjects with inline C code so that
generated files are not edited. Syntax is inspired by Java and Yacc
or Lex. The implementation is intentionally kept simple, and no C
actual code parsing is done.

Reasons:
 * C is a perfect (well mostly) language, no need for another language
 * Writing a fully featured GObject is a hassle
 * GObject has little type safety, GOB improves on it
 * Need for a generator that doesn't require changes to generated code
 * I like how Java writes method code directly into the class
