scope is a developer's tool for browsing source code.
Features:
 - Allows searching code for:
     - all references to a symbol
     - global definitions
     - functions called by a function
     - functions calling a function
     - text string
     - regular expression pattern
     - a file
     - files including a file
 - Curses based (text screen)
 - An information database is generated for faster searches and later reference
 - The fuzzy parser supports C, but is flexible enough to be useful for C++ and
   Java, and for use as a generalized 'grep database' (use it to browse large
   text documents!)
 - Has a command line mode for inclusion in scripts or as a backend to a
   GUI/frontend
 - Runs on all flavors of Unix, plus most monopoly-controlled operating systems.
