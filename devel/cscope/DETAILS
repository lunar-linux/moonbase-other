Cscope is a developer's tool for browsing source code.  Allows
searching code for: - all references to a symbol - global definitions -
functions called by a function - functions calling a function - text
string - regular expression pattern - a file - files including a file
Features: - Curses based (text screen) - An information database is
generated for faster searches and later reference - The fuzzy parser
supports C, but is flexible enough to be useful for C++ and Java,
and for use as a generalized 'grep database' (use it to browse large
text documents!)  - Has a command line mode for inclusion in scripts
or as a backend to a GUI/frontend - Runs on all flavors of Unix,
plus most monopoly-controlled operating systems.
