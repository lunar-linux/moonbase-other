           SHORT="A preprocessor for making GTK+ objects with inline C code"

cat << EOF
GOB is a preprocessor for making GTK+ objects with inline C code so
that generated files are not editted.  Syntax is inspired by java and
yacc or lex.  The implementation is intentionaly kept simple, and no C
actual code parsing is done.

Reasons:
 * C is a perfect (well mostly) language, no need for another language
 * Writing a fully featured GTK+ object is a hassle
 * GTK+ has little typesafety, GOB improves on it
 * Need for a generator that doesn't require changes to generated code
 * I like how Java writes method code directly into the class 
   definition
