 cat << EOF
This python module implements constants and functions for working with 
IEEE754 double-precision special values. It provides constants for 
Not-a-Number (NaN), Positive Infinity (Inf), and Negative Infinity 
(-Inf), as well as functions to test for these values.

The code is implemented in pure python by taking advantage of the 
'struct' standard module. Care has been taken to generate proper results 
on both big-endian and little-endian machines. Some efficiency could be 
gained by translating the core routines into C.
