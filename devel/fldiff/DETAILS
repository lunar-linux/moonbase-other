cat << EOF
fldiff is a graphical diff program that shows the differences between
two files/directories, or a file/directory and a CVS or Subversion
repository. It is inspired by xdiff (Motif-based) and xxdiff (Qt-based),
whose choice of GUI toolkit has hampered their portability to many of
the systems the author works with.

fldiff uses the Fast Light Toolkit (FLTK) and has been tested on AIX,
IRIX, Linux, MacOS X, and Solaris, and should also run on Windows.

fldiff is copyright 2005-2006 by Michael Sweet and is free software

report any problems and suggestions on the fltk.general newsgroup.
