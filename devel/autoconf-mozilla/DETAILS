NOTE: This module is strickly for those apps that are hardcoded for
the version of this module. For now firefox-47.0 is the only mozilla app that
has a problem with autoconf-2.69. The real issue is the lack of interest/motivation
by the moz dev folks to use more current versions ot autoconf.

See: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Developer_guide/Mozilla_build_FAQ

This "problem" will most likely show up as newer versions of other moz apps are released.

This module does not conflict with core/autoconf.
