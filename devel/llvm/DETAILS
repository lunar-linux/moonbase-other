LLVM is a robust system, particularly well suited for developing new mid-level
language-independent analyses and optimizations of all sorts, including those
that require extensive interprocedural analysis. LLVM is also a great target
for front-end development for conventional or research programming languages,
including those which require compile-time, link-time, or run-time optimization
for effective implementation, proper tail calls or garbage collection.
