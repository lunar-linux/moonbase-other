cat << EOF
Expect is a tool for automating interactive applications such as telnet,
ftp, passwd, fsck, rlogin, tip, etc. Expect really makes this stuff
trivial. Expect is also useful for testing these same applications. And
by adding Tk, you can also wrap interactive applications in X11 GUIs.
Expect can make easy all sorts of tasks that are prohibitively difficult
with anything else. You will find that Expect is an absolutely invaluable
tool - using it, you will be able to automate tasks that you've never
even thought of before - and you'll be able to do this automation quickly
and easily.
