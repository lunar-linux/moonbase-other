cat << EOF
Gazpacho is a GUI builder for the Gtk+-2 toolkit designed to be ultra
easy to use.  It is strongly inspired by the Glade project but it is
written from scratch using the Python language.

One of the goals of the project is that the .glade files that Gazpacho
generates should be fully compatible with libglade so you can use
Gazpacho whatever the language your application is written with.
