cat << EOF
GNU m4 is an implementation of the traditional UNIX macro processor in 
that it copies its input to the output, expanding macros as it goes. 
Macros are either built-in or user-defined and can take any number of 
arguments. M4 also has built-in functions for including named files, 
running UNIX commands, doing integer arithmetic, manipulating text in 
various ways, and recursions.
It can also be used as either a front-end to a compiler or as a macro
processor in its own right. It is often used to generate HTML as it can
give a consistent look to pages. If GNU m4 is meant to serve GNU
autoconf, beware that m4 should be fully installed *prior to*
configuring autoconf itself.
