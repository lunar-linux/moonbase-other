automake - Generates Makefile.in files
Automake automatically generates make files compliant with the GNU
coding standards. It was inspired by the 4.4 BSD make and include files,
but aims to be portable and to confrom to the GNU standards for Make
file variables and targets. Automake is a Perl script.
The input files are called Makefile.am; the output files are called
Makefile.in. They are intended for use with autoconf. Automake requires
certain things to be done in your configure.in.
This package also includes the aclocal program, which generates an
aclocal.m4 based on the contents of configure.in. It is useful as an
extensible, maintainable mechanism for augmenting autoconf.
