cat << EOF
GtkSourceCompletion is a library to add (auto)completion and calltips 
support to GtkSourceView. The library manages all events, the popup 
position etc. but it doesn't complete anything, it is the base library.
You can develop providers for GtkSourceCompletion and the library will 
use it to show all the proposals, the information for every proposal 
etc.
