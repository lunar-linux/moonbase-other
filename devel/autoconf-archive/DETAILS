The GNU Autoconf Archive is a collection of more than 500 macros for GNU
Autoconf that have been contributed as free software by friendly supporters of
the cause from all over the Internet. Every single one of those macros can be
re-used without imposing any restrictions whatsoever on the licensing of the
generated configure script. In particular, it is possible to use all those
macros in configure scripts that are meant for non-free software
