Meld is a visual diff and merge tool. It integrates especially well with CVS.
The diff viewer lets you edit files in place (diffs update dynamically), and a
middle column shows detailed changes and allows merges.
The margins show location of changes for easy navigation, and it also features
a tabbed interface that allows you to open many diffs at once.
