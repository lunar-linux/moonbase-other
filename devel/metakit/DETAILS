cat << EOF
MetaKit is an efficient embedded database library with a small footprint.
It fills the gap between flat-file, relational, object-oriented,
and tree-structured databases, supporting relational joins, serialization,
nested structures, and instant schema evolution. There is a C++ API, a
Python binding called Mk4py, and a Tcl binding called Mk4tcl. You can
manipulate and exchange data with any of these. Data files are portable,
use auto-sizing ints and strings, and have the ability to very efficiently
store binary data, from single bits to multi-Mb objects. The library has
been used on Unix, Windows, Macintosh, VMS, and others, spanning a range
of 16- to 64-bit architectures.
