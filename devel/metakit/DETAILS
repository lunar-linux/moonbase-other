cat << EOF
MetaKit is an efficient embedded database library with a small footprint.
It fills the gap between flat-file, relational, object-oriented, 
and tree-structured databases, supporting relational joins, serialization, 
nested structures, and instant schema evolution. There is a C++ API, a 
Python binding called Mk4py, and a Tcl binding called Mk4tcl. You can 
manipulate and exchange data with any of these. Data files are portable, 
use auto-sizing ints and strings, and have the ability to very efficiently 
store binary data, from single bits to multi-Mb objects. The library has 
been used on Unix, Windows, Macintosh, VMS, and others, spanning a range 
of 16- to 64-bit architectures.
