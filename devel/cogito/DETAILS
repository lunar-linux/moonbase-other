cat << EOF
Cogito is a version control system layered on top of the git tree history
storage system. It aims at seamless user interface and ease of use, providing
generally smoother user experience than the "raw" Core GIT itself and indeed
many other version control systems.

Note that you can MOSTLY use it in parallel of other GIT
frontends (e.g. StGIT), as well as the Linus' GIT plumbing and core GIT
tools - they only need to keep HEAD in place and follow the standardized
refs/ hierarchy. The exception is that you should stick with a single
toolkit during a merge and mostly stick with Cogito while your tree is
in cg-seek'd state.
