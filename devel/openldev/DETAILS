OpenLDev is a development environment that provides a graphical
front-end to Linux compilers such as gcc. OpenLDev focuses on C and
C++ development.  It provides project templates for console
applications to those that take advantage of the Gtk+ and Gtkmm 
libraries.  Project and autotools management is provided through a few
streamlined dialogs that help the user by removing the need to edit
Makefiles.  The GtkSourceView widget performs syntax highlighting,
which gives users of GEdit a familiar work environment.
