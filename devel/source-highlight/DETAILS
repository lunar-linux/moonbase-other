cat << EOF
This program, given a source file, produces a document with syntax highlighting.
It also provides a C++ highlight library. Source-highlight reads source language
specifications dynamically, thus it can be easily extended (without recompiling
the sources) for handling new languages.
It also reads output format specifications dynamically, and thus it can be easily
extended (without recompiling the sources) for handling new output formats. The
syntax for these specifications is quite easy (take a look at the manual).
Source-highlight is a command line program, and it can also be used as a CGI.
Notice that source-highlight can also be used as a formatter (i.e., without
highlighting): you can, for instance, format a txt file in HTML (and it will take
care of translating special characters, such as, <, >, &).
Source-highlight can also generate cross references; in order to do this it relies
on GNU Ctags. These are the output formats already supported:
  HTML HTML5 XHTML
  LATEX
  MediaWiki
  ODF
  TEXINFO
  ANSI color escape sequences (you can use this feature with less)
  DocBook
  S-expressions
  Groff.
