Subversion is a free/open-source version control system. That
is, Subversion manages files and directories over time. A tree
of files is placed into a central repository. The repository is
much like an ordinary file server, except that it remembers every
change ever made to your files and directories. This allows you
to recover older versions of your data, or examine the history
of how your data changed. In this regard, many people think of
a version control system as a sort of time machine.
