cat << EOF
Ivman is an extremely flexible desktop independent frontend to HAL, the
userspace Hardware Abstraction Layer for Linux. It can be used to execute
arbitrary commands when devices are added to or removed from your system, when
device properties change, or when devices emit conditions. Any properties of
the new or changed device can be included within the executed command.
