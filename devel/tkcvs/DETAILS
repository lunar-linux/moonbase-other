TkCVS is a Tcl/Tk-based graphical interface to the CVS configuration
management system. It displays the status of the files in the current
working directory, and provides buttons and menus to execute CVS
commands on the selected files. TkDiff is included for browsing and
merging your changes.

TkCVS extends CVS with a method to produce a browsable, "user
friendly" listing of modules in the repository. This requires that the
CVSROOT/modules file actually lists some modules. Additional comment
fields can be added to make the browser more informative.
