cat << EOF
Rake, a simple Ruby build program with capabilities similar to make, has
the following features:
    * Rakefiles (rake's version of Makefiles) are completely defined in
      standard Ruby syntax. No XML files to edit. No quirky Makefile
      syntax to worry about (is that a tab or a space?)
    * Users can specify tasks with prerequisites.
    * Rake supports rule patterns to sythesize implicit tasks.
    * Flexible FileLists that act like arrays but know about
      manipulating file names and paths.
    * A library of prepackaged tasks to make building rakefiles easier.
