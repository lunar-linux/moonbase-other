Xfdiff is a graphic interface to the GNU diff and patch commands. With this
utility, you can view differences side by side for files or directories. You
can also view differences that applying a patch file would imply, without
applying the patch. You can also apply patches to the hard disc or create patch
files for differences between files or directories. All-in-all, a handy utility
for lazy chaps who don't want to type the diff command.
