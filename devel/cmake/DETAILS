Welcome to CMake, the cross-platform, open-source make system. CMake
is used to control the software compilation process using simple
platform and compiler independent configuration files. CMake generates
native makefiles and workspaces that can be used in the compiler
environment of your choice. CMake is quite sophisticated: it is
possible to support complex environments requiring system
configuration, pre-processor generation, code generation, and template
instantiation. Please go here to learn more about CMake.
