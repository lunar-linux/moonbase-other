           SHORT="A hierarchical, reference counted memory pool system with destructors"

cat << EOF
talloc is a small wrapper around malloc that makes memory hierarchical. It is 
similar to a standard memory pool system, but much more powerful as any 
pointer returned by talloc is also a pool. This allows you to hang structures 
off other structures in an intuitive fashion, and free up a whole subtree of 
memory with one call. talloc also features type safety, destructors, and many 
helper functions.
