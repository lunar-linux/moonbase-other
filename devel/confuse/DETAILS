cat << EOF
libConfuse is a configuration file parser library, licensed under
the terms of the ISC license, and written in C. It supports sections
and (lists of) values (strings, integers, floats, booleans or other
sections), as well as some other features (such as single/double-quoted
strings, environment variable expansion, functions and nested include
statements). It makes it very easy to add configuration file capability
to a program using a simple API.
