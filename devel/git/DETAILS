cat << EOF
Linus Torvalds new toolset for a "userland filesystem upon which other SCM
implementations are being built or adapted."

This is a stupid (but extremely fast) directory content manager. It doesn't
do a whole lot, but what it _does_ do is track directory contents efficiently.

There are two object abstractions: the "object database", and the "current
directory cache" aka "index".
