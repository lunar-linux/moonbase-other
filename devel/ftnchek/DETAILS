ftnchek is a static analyzer for Fortran 77 programs. It is designed to
detect certain errors in a Fortran program that a compiler usually does
not. ftnchek is not primarily intended to detect syntax errors. Its
purpose is to assist the user in finding semantic errors. Semantic
errors are legal in the Fortran language but are wasteful or may cause
incorrect operation. For example, variables which are never used
may indicate some omission in the program; uninitialized variables
contain garbage which may cause incorrect results to be calculated;
and variables which are not declared may not have the intended
type. ftnchek is intended to assist users in the debugging of their
Fortran program. It is not intended to catch all syntax errors. This is
the function of the compiler. Prior to using ftnchek, the user should
verify that the program compiles correctly.
