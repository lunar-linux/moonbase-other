cat << EOF
This tutorial assumes no previous knowledge of scripting or programming, but
progresses rapidly toward an intermediate/advanced level of instruction ...all
the while sneaking in little snippets of UNIX wisdom and lore. It serves as a
textbook, a manual for self-study, and a reference and source of knowledge on
shell scripting techniques. The exercises and heavily-commented examples
invite active reader participation, under the premise that the only way to
really learn scripting is to write scripts.
