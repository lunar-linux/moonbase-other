           SHORT="An in-depth exploration of the gentle art of shell scripting"

cat << EOF
This tutorial assumes no previous knowledge of scripting or programming, 
but progresses rapidly toward an intermediate/advanced level of 
instruction ...all the while sneaking in little snippets of UNIX wisdom 
and lore. It serves as a textbook, a manual for self-study, and a 
reference and source of knowledge on shell scripting techniques. The 
exercises and heavily-commented examples invite active reader 
participation, under the premise that the only way to really learn 
scripting is to write scripts.
