This tutorial assumes no previous knowledge of scripting or programming,
but progresses rapidly toward an intermediate/advanced level of
instruction ...all the while sneaking in little snippets of UNIX wisdom
and lore. It serves as a textbook, a manual for self-study, and a
reference and source of knowledge on shell scripting techniques. The
exercises and heavily-commented examples invite active reader
participation, under the premise that the only way to really learn
scripting is to write scripts.
