Nicotine+ is an attempt to keep Nicotine working with the latest libraries,
kill bugs, keep current with the Soulseek protocol and add some new
features that users want and/or need.
Nicotine is a SoulSeek client written in Python, based on the PySoulSeek
project by Alexander Kanavin. It features, among other things, a completely
rewritten graphical user interface which uses the PyGTK-2 toolkit and a
less strict user request policy.
