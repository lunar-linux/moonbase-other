LAM/MPI is a high quality implementation of the Message Passing Interface
(MPI) Standard. LAM/MPI provides high performance on a variety of
platforms, from small off-the-shelf single CPU clusters to large SMP
machines with high speed networks, even in heterogenous environments.
In addition to high performance, LAM provides a number of usability
features key to developing large scale MPI applications.
