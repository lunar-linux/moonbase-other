cat << EOF
kitty is designed for power keyboard users. To that end all its controls work
with the keyboard (although it fully supports mouse interactions as well).
Its configuration is a simple, human editable, single file for easy
reproducibility (I like to store configuration in source control).

The code in kitty is designed to be simple, modular and hackable. It is written
in a mix of C (for performance sensitive parts) and Python (for easy
hackability of the UI). It does not depend on any large and complex UI toolkit,
using only OpenGL for rendering everything.

Finally, kitty is designed from the ground up to support all modern terminal
features, such as unicode, true color, bold/italic fonts, text formatting, etc.
It even extends existing text formatting escape codes, to add support for
features not available elsewhere, such as colored and styled (curly) underlines.
One of the design goals of kitty is to be easily extensible so that new features
can be added in the future with relatively less effort.
