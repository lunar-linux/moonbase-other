Screen is a full-screen window manager that multiplexes a physical
terminal between several processes, typically interactive shells.
Each virtual terminal provides the functions of the DEC VT100
terminal and, in addition, several control functions from the
ANSI X3.64 (ISO 6429) and ISO 2022 standards (e.g., insert/delete
line and support for multiple character sets).
