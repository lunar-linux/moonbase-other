cat << EOF
Restore tmux environment after system restart.
Tmux is great, except when you have to restart the computer. You lose all the
running programs, working directories, pane layouts etc. There are helpful
management tools out there, but they require initial configuration and
continuous updates as your workflow evolves or you start new projects.
tmux-resurrect saves all the little details from your tmux environment so it
can be completely restored after a system restart (or when you feel like it).
No configuration is required. You should feel like you never quit tmux.

Add this line to the bottom of .tmux.conf:
run-shell /usr/share/tmux-resurrect/resurrect.tmux
