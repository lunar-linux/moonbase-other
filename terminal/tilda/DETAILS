Tilda is a terminal emulator and can be compared with other popular terminal
emulators such as gnome-terminal (Gnome), Konsole (KDE), xterm and many others.
The specialities of Tilda are that it does not behave like a normal window but
instead it can be pulled up and down from the top of the screen with a special
hotkey. Additionally Tilda is highly configurable. It is possible to configure
the hotkeys for keybindings, change the appearance and many options that affect
the behavior of Tilda.
