Multi Gnome Terminal is a powered and extended version of gnome
terminal, which supports many terminals in each window, fast switching
between different terminals using shortcuts, and much more. All these
extensions are inspired by screen and konsole (the terminal emulator of
kde2). Each hidden terminal also shows in its tab its state (i.e.,
whether it's changing or it's changed or nothing's happened).
