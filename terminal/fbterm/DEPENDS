depends fontconfig

# until the fbterm guys fix their buggy configure.ac ...

# (If you don't have gpm installed, configure fails with
# "error: can't find gpm.h required by gpm mouse support!")

# ... we use gpm as required instead of optional dep
depends gpm

# I'll leave the opt dep in here so switching to opt dep will be easy
