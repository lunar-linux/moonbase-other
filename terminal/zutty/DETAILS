cat << EOF
Zutty is a terminal emulator for the X Window System, functionally similar to
several other X terminal emulators such as xterm, rxvt and countless others.
It is also similar to other, much more modern, GPU-accelerated terminal
emulators such as Alacritty and Kitty. What really sets Zutty apart is its
radically simple, yet extremely efficient rendering implementation, enabling
it to perform seamlessly in resource-constrained environments where others
struggle or fail. At the same time, Zutty aims to implement a sufficiently
complete feature set to make it useful for a wide range of users, and strives
to conform to relevant (actual or de-facto) standards.
