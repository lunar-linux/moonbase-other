cat << EOF
Mrxvt (previously named as materm) is a lightweight and powerful multi-tabbed
X terminal emulator based on the popular rxvt and aterm. It implements many
useful features seen in some modern X terminal emulators, like gnome-terminal
and konsole, but keep to be lightweight and independent from the GNOME and KDE
desktop environment.
