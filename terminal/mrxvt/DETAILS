cat << EOF
Mrxvt (previously named materm) is a lightweight, powerful multi-tabbed
X terminal emulator based on rxvt version 2.7.11 CVS and aterm. It implements
many useful features seen in some modern X terminal emulators (like
gnome-terminal and konsole) but aims to be fast, lightweight and independent of
standard toolkits or desktop environments (e.g. Gnome / KDE).
