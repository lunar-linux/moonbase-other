Its main features (many of them unique) over rxvt are:

    * Stores text in Unicode (either UCS-2 or UCS-4).
    * Uses locale-correct input, output and width: as long as your system
      supports the locale, rxvt-unicode will display correctly.
    * Daemon mode: one daemon can open multiple windows on multiple displays,
      which improves memory usage and startup time considerably.
    * Embedded perl, for endless customization and improvement opportunities,
      such as:
          o Tabbed terminal support.
          o Regex-driven customisable selection that can properly select shell
            arguments, urls etc.
          o Selection-transformation and option popup menus.
          o Automatically transforming the selection once made.
          o Incremental scrollback buffer search.
          o Automatic URL-underlining and launching.
          o Remote pastebin, digital clock, block graphics to ascii filter and
            whatever you like to implement for yourself.
    * Crash-free. At least I try, but rxvt-unicode certainly crashes much less
      often than rxvt and its many clones, and reproducible bugs get fixed
      immediately.
    * Completely flicker-free.
    * Re-wraps long lines instead of splitting or cutting them on resizes.
    * Full combining character support (unlike xterm :).
    * Multiple fonts supported at the same time: No need to choose between nice
      japanese and ugly latin, or no japanese and nice latin characters :).
    * Supports Xft and core fonts in any combination.
    * Can easily be embedded into other applications.
    * All documentation accessible through manpages.
    * Locale-independent XIM support.
    * Many small improvements, such as improved and corrected terminfo,
      improved secondary screen modes, italic and bold font support, tinting
      and shading.
    * Encapsulation of privileged operations in a separate process (improves
      security).
    * Optimised for local and remote connections.
