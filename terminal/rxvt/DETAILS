cat << EOF
rxvt is a colour vt102 terminal emulator intended as an xterm(1)
replacement for users who do not require features such as Tektronix
4014 emulation and toolkit-style configurability. As a result, rxvt
uses much less swap space -- a significant advantage on a machine
serving many X sessions.
