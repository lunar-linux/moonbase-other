A "clone" of the famous Hyperterminal. But it is much more simple, that
is to say, that it can only communicate with a serial link and that it
does not support all the modem protocols. If you are searching for a
more complete application of that kind that is more dedicated to be
used with a modem, have a look at minicom.
