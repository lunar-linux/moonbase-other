A "clone" of the famous Hyperterminal. But it is much more simple, that 
is to say, that it can only communicate with a serial link and that it 
does not support all the modem protocols. If you are searching for a 
more complete application of that kind that is more dedicated to be 
used with a modem, have a look at minicom.
