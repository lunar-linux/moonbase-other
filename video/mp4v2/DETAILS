cat << EOF
The MP4V2 library provides an API to create and modify mp4 files as defined by 
ISO-IEC:14496-1:2001 MPEG-4 Systems. This file format is derived from Apple's 
QuickTime file format that has been used as a multimedia file format in a 
variety of platforms and applications. It is a very powerful and extensible 
format that can accomodate practically any type of media.

mp4v2 used to be part of the mpeg4ip library (http://mpeg4ip.sourceforge.net/),
but has been moved into its own maintained library due to a combination of the 
cessation of support of mpeg4ip and the usefulness of this library on its own.
