GPAC is an Open Source multimedia framework for research and academic purposes.
It is written in (almost 100% ANSI) C for portability reasons (embedded
platforms and DSPs), attempting to keep the memory footprint as low as
possible.

The project is intended to a wide audience ranging from end-users or content
creators with development skills who want to experiment the new standards for
interactive technologies or want to convert files for mobile devices, to
developers who need players and/or server for multimedia streaming applications.
