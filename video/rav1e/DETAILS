rav1e is an AV1 video encoder. It is designed to eventually cover all use cases,
though in its current form it is most suitable for cases where libaom (the
reference encoder) is too slow.
Features:
 - Intra, inter, and switch frames
 - 64x64 superblocks
 - 4x4 to 64x64 RDO-selected square and rectangular blocks
 - DC, H, V, Paeth, smooth, and all directional prediction modes
 - DCT, (FLIP-)ADST and identity transforms (up to 64x64, 16x16 and 32x32 respectively)
 - 8-, 10- and 12-bit depth color
 - 4:2:0, 4:2:2 and 4:4:4 chroma sampling
 - 11 speed settings (0-10, exhaustive to near real-time)
 - Constant quantizer and target bitrate (single- and multi-pass) encoding modes
 - Still picture mode.
