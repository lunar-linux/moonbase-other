ProjectX enters the picture. It works like an MPEG-2 TS hardware
decoder, splitting the transport stream into its components (MPEG
elementary streams like audio, video, and other data (e.g.
teletext)).

While splitting the transport stream, ProjectX also checks the
stream for errors and synchronizes video and audio. If ProjectX
converts the transport stream to another format, it won't analyze
and fix streams as thoroughly as in split mode.
