The libXvMCW will allow many media players to use hardware MPEG-2
acceleration built in modern graphics chips. Very useful for
watching DVD's or digital TV without overloading CPU.  libXvMCW is a
wrapper library to provide universal access to native video hardware
acceleration libraries designed for many new graphics chipsets. Thanks
to libXvMCW library developers of video players no more have to write
hardware dependent code to support video hardware acceleration on every
graphics chipset on the market. This library is used for example by
xine (by selecting 'xxmc' video output).  Supported graphics chipsets
(for example): Intel i810 and other nVidia Riva TNT/Geforce 1, 2,
3, 4Ti (MC acceleartion) nVidia Geforce 4MX, FX5xxx, 6 (iDCT and MC
acceleration) Via CLExxx KMxxx KNxxx K8Nxxx and other and many other
not mentioned here...
