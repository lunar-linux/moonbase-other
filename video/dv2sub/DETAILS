This is dv2sub, a simple util that extracts the date and time of recording 
from a dv video file (using libdv) and outputs it as a subtitle file.  It 
can also display useful information about the dv stream, like video norm 
(PAL/NTSC), aspect ratio normal (4:3) or wide (16:9), interlaced or 
progressive material, number of audio channels, audio sampling frequency, 
number of audio samples, timestamp and recording date & time. 

Be sure the input file or stream is in pure RAW DV format. dv2sub doesn't 
work with DV AVI files (type 1 or type 2)
