cat << EOF
DirectFB is a thin library that provides developers with hardware 
graphics acceleration, input device handling and abstraction, integrated 
windowing system with support for translucent windows and multiple 
display layers on top of the Linux Framebuffer Device. 
It is a complete hardware abstraction layer with software fallbacks for 
every graphics operation that is not supported by the underlying hardware. 
DirectFB adds graphical power to embedded systems and sets a new standard 
for graphics under Linux.
