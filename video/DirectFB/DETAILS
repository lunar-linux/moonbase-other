cat << EOF
DirectFB is a thin library that provides developers with hardware
graphics acceleration, input device handling and abstraction, integrated
windowing system with support for translucent windows and multiple
display layers on top of the Linux Framebuffer Device.
It is a complete hardware abstraction layer with software fallbacks for
every graphics operation that is not supported by the underlying hardware.
DirectFB adds graphical power to embedded systems and sets a new standard
for graphics under Linux.
