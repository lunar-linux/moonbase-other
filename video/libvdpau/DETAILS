cat << EOF
To use this wrapper you need VDPAU driver library provided with your
GPU driver. This means that now you can use this wrapper with Nvidia
Geforce8 or later GPU using NVIDIA or NVIDIA-beta Lunar module.
Other GPU manufacturers will follow as VDPAU is going to mature.
Intel GPUs have libva to VDPAU wrapper which allow the use of VDPAU on
Intel GPUs.
To actually use a VDPAU device, you need
a vendor-specific implementation library.  Currently, this is always
libvdpau_nvidia.  You can override the driver name by setting the
VDPAU_DRIVER environment variable.

VDPAU (Video Decoding and Presentation Api for Unix)
is new and more powerful replacement for XvMC
advanced video acceleration library.
XvMC in it's the most advanced capability allowed for acceleration of:
*MC (Motion Compensation)
*iDCT (inverse Discrete Cosinus Transform)
*CSC (color space conversion) provided by Xv
*bob deinterlacing
for single MPEG-1 or MPEG-2 video stream only.

VDPAU wrapper library is glue code between:
*video player
*X server
*video hardware represented by manufacturer's vdpau library
VDPAU is open source full hardware acceleration interface
designed to accelerate at bitstream level (which includes:
MC,iDCT,CSC and much more):
*VC-1
*WMV3
*WMV9
*H.264 known as MPEG-4 AVC
*MPEG-4 part2
*DivX4
*DivX5
*MPEG-1
*MPEG-2
VDPAU allows:
*better deinterlacing than bob,
*multiple video streams decoding at once,
*higher scaling quality.
