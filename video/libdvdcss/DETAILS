           SHORT="A library for DVD CSS decrpytion"

cat << EOF
libdvdcss is a cross-platform library for transparent DVD device
access with on the fly CSS decryption. It currently runs under Linux,
FreeBSD, BSD/OS, Solaris, BeOS, Win98 and Win2k. It is used for the
vlc DVD player because of its portability and because, unlike similar
libraries, it does not require your DVD drive to be region-locked.

There are new features in libdvdcss with the 1.2.1 release.
You have to choose your decryption method with a run time environment variable:

export DVDCSS_METHOD=title
export DVDCSS_METHOD=disc
export DVDCSS_METHOD=key

Reportedly the "key" method will work the same way things did before.
