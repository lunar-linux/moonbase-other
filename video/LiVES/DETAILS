What is LiVES ?

LiVES began as the Linux Video Editing System. Since it now runs on
more operating systems, LiVES is a Video Editing System. It is
designed to be simple to use, yet powerful. It is small in size,
yet it has many advanced features.

LiVES is part editor, part VJ tool. It is fully extendible through
open standard RFX plugin scripts.

LiVES lets you start editing and making video right away, without
having to worry about formats, frame sizes, or framerates. LiVES
will let you start creating your own tools, utilities and effects
via the built in RFX builder.

LiVES is aimed at the digital video artist who wants to create their
own content, the video editor who wants to create professional
looking video, and the VJ who wants to captivate with spectacular
images.
