Matroska aims to become the Standard of Multimedia Container Formats. It is
based on EBML (Extensible Binary Meta Language), a binary derivative of XML.
EBML enables the Matroska Development Team to gain significant advantages in
terms of future format extensibility, without breaking file support in old
parsers.

First, it is essential to clarify exactly "What an Audio/Video container is",
to avoid any misunderstandings.
 - It is NOT a video compression format
 - It cannot be used to compress music or pictures like MP3 or JPEG, as it is
   not a codec.
 - It is an envelope for which there can be many audio, video and subtitles
   streams, allowing the user to store a complete movie in one single file.
   This ensures that the audio and video can be played in most Media players.

Matroska is designed with the future in mind. It incorporates features you
would expect from a modern container format, like:
 - Streamable over internet (HTTP and RTP)
 - Fast seeking in the file
 - High error recovery
 - Menus (like DVDs have)
 - Chapter entries
 - Selectable subtitle streams
 - Selectable audio streams
 - Modularly Extendable
