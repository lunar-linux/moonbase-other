Kino is a non-linear DV editor for GNU/Linux. It features excellent
integration with IEEE-1394 for capture, VTR control, and recording
back to the camera. It captures video to disk in RawDV and AVI format,
in both type-1 DV and type-2 DV (separate audio stream) encodings.

You can load multiple video clips, cut and paste portions of
video/audio, and save it to an edit decision list (SMIL XML
format). Most edit and navigation commands are mapped to equivalent
vi key commands. Also, Kino can load movies and export the composite
movie in a number of formats: DV over IEEE 1394, Raw DV, DV AVI, still
frames, WAV, MP3, Ogg Vorbis, MPEG-1, MPEG-2, and DivX.  Still frame
export uses Imlib1, which has built-in support for PPM, JPEG, PNG,
TIFF, GIF, and whatever your ImageMagick installation supports. MP3
requires lame. Ogg Vorbis requires oggenc. MPEG-1, MPEG-2, and DivX
require mjpegtools 1.6.0. RPM and Debian packages as well as tarballs
are available.
