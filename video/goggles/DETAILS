Goggles DVD Player is a frontend for Ogle DVD player. Besides the 
usual features like having a play button etc, Goggles tries to 
provide features not often found in other dvd players. Since Ogle 
in itself is only a dvd player, it has some neat capabilities that 
"general" media players cannot provide. Goggles extends these 
capabilities with a very userfriendly interface. See below for a 
list of some the feautures.

Goggles' attractive and responsive userinterface is written using 
the FOX Toolkit
