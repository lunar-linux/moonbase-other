Goggles DVD Player is a frontend for Ogle DVD player. Besides the
usual features like having a play button etc, Goggles tries to
provide features not often found in other dvd players. Since Ogle
in itself is only a dvd player, it has some neat capabilities that
"general" media players cannot provide. Goggles extends these
capabilities with a very userfriendly interface. See below for a
list of some the feautures.

Goggles' attractive and responsive userinterface is written using
the FOX Toolkit
