cat << EOF
The "z" library implements the commonly required image processing basics of
scaling, colorspace conversion, and depth conversion. A simple API enables
conversion between any supported formats to operate with minimal knowledge
from the programmer. All library routines were designed from the ground-up
with correctness, flexibility, and thread-safety as first priorities.
Allocation, buffering, and I/O are cleanly separated from processing,
allowing the programmer to adapt "z" to many scenarios.
