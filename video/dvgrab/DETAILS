If you have properly configured your kernel and your ieee1394 device
drivers, you should end up with about 30 MByte of DV image data nicely
packed in a file myfilm001.avi (digits and extension automatically
appended), which can be displayed with the Microsoft Media Player or a
similar program (remember to install the required DV codecs, software
should be included with your hardware).

Use the program at your own risk. The ieee1394 subsystem is still
experimental. Do not use any ieee1394 related software on a system
that you cannot afford to lose.
