Unleash the 50,000 watt flamethrower of content creation in your UNIX box. 
Cinelerra does primarily 3 things: capturing, compositing, and editing audio 
and video with sample level accuracy. It's a movie studio in a box.  If you 
want the same kind of editing suite that the big boys use, on an efficient 
UNIX operating system, it's time for Cinelerra.

Cinelerra is not community approved and there is no support from the developer.
