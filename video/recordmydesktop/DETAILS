cat << EOF
desktop session recorder for GNU / linux that attemps to be easy to use, yet
also effective at it's primary task. As such, the program is separated in two
parts; a simple command line tool that performs the basic tasks of capturing
and encoding and an interface that exposes the program functionality in a
usable way. The commandline tool (which essentially is recordMyDesktop), is
written in C, while there are two frontends, written in python with pyGtk
(gtk-recordMyDesktop) and pyQt4 (qt-recordMyDesktop). recordMyDesktop offers
also the ability to record audio through ALSA, OSS or the JACK audio server.
