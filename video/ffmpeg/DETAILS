FFmpeg is the first complete and free Internet Live Audio and Video
Broadcasting solution. FFMpeg aims at being the command line tool to
handle audio and video. It is a "three-in-one" solution. FFmpeg
includes a soft VCR capable of encoding in many different formats
simultaneously, a streaming server for Netcasting multimedia.
FFmpeg generates streaming files, in many popular formats
simultaneously, faster than any other solution.

Note: DO NOT BUMP THIS MODULE. They are going through MAJOR ABI/API
revisions, and this is the last good revision. So don't EVEN THINK
ABOUT IT!
