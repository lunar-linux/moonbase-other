Bookcase is an KDE application for keeping track of your collections. It 
provides default templates for books, bibliographies, videos, music, coins, 
stamps, trading cards, comic books, and wines. 
Bookcase allows you to enter your collection in a catalogue database, saving 
many different properties like title, author, etc. Two different views of your 
collection are shown. On the left, your entries are grouped together by any 
field you like, allowing you to see how many are in each group. On the right, 
selected fields are shown in column format, allowing you to sort by any field. 
On the bottom is a customizable HTML view of the current entry. The entry 
editor is a dialog box where you enter the data.
