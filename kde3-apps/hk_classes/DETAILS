cat << EOF
hk_classes is a set of non-visual routines which allow you to develop
database frontend applications as easy as possible.
You need also a database driver to run applications. Drivers for
  * Mysql
  * PostgreSQL 
  * SQLite 
  * ODBC
are included in this library and will be automatically installed if 
configure finds a working Mysql/PostgreSQL/SQLite/ODBC installation 
on your computer.
