Gnometoaster is a full CD creation suite for X11 and GNOME. It can be 
used to copy and create data, audio, and mixed mode CDs on the fly or 
with precaching in both TAO and DAO mode. Data tracks can easily be 
created with the built-in file manager. GNOME drag-and-drop is 
supported throughout the program. Gnometoaster can also write MP3 
files on the fly, is fully multisession capable, and can be used to 
encode all sorts of filetypes directly from audio audio tracks on a CD.
