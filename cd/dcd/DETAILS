dave's cd player (dcd) is a simple command-line CD player. It plays
CDs, loops (sequences of) tracks, plays tracks at random, and so on. Its
a full featured, but simple-to-use CD player. It supports track lists
via the libmusicbrainz library, and yet remains one of the leanest CD
players out there.
