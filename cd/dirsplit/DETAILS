displit is designed to for a simple purpose: convert a directory
with many multiple files (which are all smaller than a certain
medium, eg.  DVD) and "splits" it into "volumes", looking for
the optimal order to get the best space/medium-number efficiency.

The  actual action is either adding the files to mkisofs catalogs
or real moving of files into new directories (or creating links
or symlinks). The method is not limited to files,
whole directories can also be handled  this  way  (see  various
filesystem exploration modes).
