recording using a DVD burner, primarily via the "growisofs" utility."

growisofs was originally designed as a frontend to mkisofs to facilitate
appending of data to ISO9660 volumes residing on random-access media such as
DVD+RW, DVD-RAM, plain files, hard disk partitions.  In the course of
development general purpose DVD recording support was implemented, and as of
now growisofs supports not only random-access media, but even mastering of
multi-session DVD media such as DVD+R and DVD-R/-RW. In addition growisofs
supports first-/single-session recording of arbitrary pre-mastered image
(formatted as UDF, ISO9660 or any other file system, if formatted at all) to
all supported DVD media types.
