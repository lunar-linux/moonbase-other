cat << EOF
cdlabelgen generates frontcards and traycards for CDs. It was designed to
simplify the process of generating labels for CD's. It originated as a program
to allow auto generation of frontcards and traycards for CD's burned via an
automated mechanism (specifically for archiving data), but has now become
popular for labelling CD compilations of mp3's, and copies of CDs as well.
