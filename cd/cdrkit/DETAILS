Derived from the various programs distributed in the cdrtools suite, cdrkit
aims to maintain interface compatibility with those tools. The cdrecord
program has been renamed to wodim ("write optical disk media") so that users
will not confuse it with the original cdrecord, which is still maintained by
its author, Jorg Schilling. wodim, and the other programs distributed with
cdrkit, will retain a user interface compatible with the corresponding
programs from the cdrtools 2.01.01a08 release, at least for the near future.
Thus, front-end programs, such as GUI-based CD writer applications, should be
able to use cdrkit merely by substituting the name "wodim" for the name
"cdrecord".
