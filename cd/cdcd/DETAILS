cdcd is a CLI CD player designed to incorporate all the features of the X
and curses based CD players, without having to use a clunky push-button
interface or having a console hogged with a curses-based CD player.

cdcd can accept commands directly off of the command line, or in a query
mode similar to such programs as telnet and ftp.

CDDBP and HTTP mode CDDB support is included, and now CD Index support as
well. cdcd also supports CD-ROM changers on Linux 2.1/2.2 systems
