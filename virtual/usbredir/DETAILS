cat <<EOF
usbredir is the name of a network protocol for sending usb device traffic over
a network connection. It is also the name of the software package offering a
parsing library, a usbredirhost library and several utilities implementing this
protocol.
usbredir was created for use with Spice but the protocol and the usbredirhost
are completely independent of spice, they could for example also be used to
create a vnc extension for redirecting usb devices over a vnc connection to a
qemu virtual machine.
The usbguest side is currently only implemented for qemu, and shipped as part of
qemu (enabling this in qemu requires the libusbredirparser library to be
available when building qemu).
usbredir supports USB device filtering configurable by a filter string.
