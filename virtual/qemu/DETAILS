By using dynamic translation it achieves a reasonable speed while being easy
to port on new host CPUs. QEMU has two operating modes:

User mode emulation. In this mode, QEMU can launch Linux processes compiled
for one CPU on another CPU. Linux system calls are converted because of
endianness and 32/64 bit mismatches. Wine (Windows API emulator) and DOSEMU
(DOS emulation) are the main targets for QEMU.

Full system emulation. In this mode, QEMU emulates a full system, including
a processor and various peripherials. It enables easier testing and
debugging of system code. It can also be used to provide virtual hosting of
several virtual PC on a single server.

As QEMU requires no host kernel patches to run, it is very safe and easy to use.
