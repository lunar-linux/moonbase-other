cat << EOF
Conmon is a monitoring program and communication tool between a container
manager (like podman or CRI-O) and an OCI runtime (like runc or crun) for
a single container.
Upon being launched, it double-forks to daemonize and detach from the
parent that launched it. It then launches the runtime as its child. This
allows managing processes to die in the foreground, but still be able to
watch over and connect to the child process (the container).
While the container runs, conmon does two things:
Provides a socket for attaching to the container, holding open the
container's standard streams and forwarding them over the socket.
Writes the contents of the container's streams to a log file (or to the
systemd journal) so they can be read after the container's death.
Finally, upon the containers death, conmon will record its exit time and
code to be read by the managing programs.
