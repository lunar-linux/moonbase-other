Wine implements its own version of Internet Explorer. The implementation is 
based on a custom version of Mozilla's Gecko Layout Engine. When your 
application tries to display a web page, it loads Wine's custom Gecko from the
file wine_gecko-1.0.0-x86.cab (at least in the latest version of Wine; older 
versions of Wine use older versions of Gecko).
