Wine implements its own version of Internet Explorer. The
implementation is based on a custom version of Mozilla's Gecko Layout
Engine. When your application tries to display a web page, it loads
Wine's custom Gecko from the file wine_gecko-1.4-x86.msi (at least in
the latest version of Wine; older versions of Wine use older versions
of Gecko).

After installing this, wine will not prompt you to download gecko.
