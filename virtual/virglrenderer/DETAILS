           SHORT="A virtual 3D GPU library to accelerate 3D rendering"

cat <<EOF
The project entails creating a virtual 3D capable graphics card for virtual
machines running inside qemu. The design of this card is based around the
concepts of Gallium3D to make writing Mesa and (eventually) Direct3D drivers
for it easy.
The card natively uses the Gallium TGSI intermediate representation for its
shaders. The implementation of rendering for the card is done in the host
system as part of qemu and is implemented purely on OpenGL so you can
accelerated rendering on any sufficiently capable card/driver combination.
