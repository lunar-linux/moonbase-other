cat << EOF
CRI-O is meant to provide an integration path between OCI conformant runtimes
and the kubelet. Specifically, it implements the Kubelet Container Runtime
Interface (CRI) using OCI conformant runtimes. The scope of CRI-O is tied to
the scope of the CRI.
At a high level, we expect the scope of CRI-O to be restricted to the following functionalities:
 - Support multiple image formats including the existing Docker image format
 - Support for multiple means to download images including trust & image
   verification
 - Container image management (managing image layers, overlay filesystems, etc)
 - Container process lifecycle management
 - Monitoring and logging required to satisfy the CRI
 - Resource isolation as required by the CRI.
