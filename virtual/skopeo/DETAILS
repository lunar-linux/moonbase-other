skopeo can work with OCI images as well as the original Docker v2 images.
Skopeo works with API V2 registries such as Docker registries, the Atomic
registry, private registries, local directories and local OCI-layout
directories. Skopeo does not require a daemon to be running to perform
these operations:
 - Copying an image from and to various storage mechanisms.
 - Inspecting a remote image showing its properties including its layers,
   without requiring you to pull the image to the host.
 - Deleting an image from an image repository.
 - When required by the repository, skopeo can pass the appropriate
   credentials and certificates for authentication.
Skopeo operates on the following image and repository types:
 - containers-storage:docker-reference An image located in a local
   containers/storage image store. Location and image store specified in
   /etc/containers/storage.conf
 - dir:path An existing local directory path storing the manifest, layer
   tarballs and signatures as individual files. This is a non-standardized
   format, primarily useful for debugging or noninvasive container inspection.
 - docker://docker-reference An image in a registry implementing the "Docker
   Registry HTTP API V2". By default, uses the authorization state in
   $HOME/.docker/config.json, which is set e.g. using (docker login).
 - docker-archive:path[:docker-reference] An image is stored in the docker save
   formated file. docker-reference is only used when creating such a file, and
   it must not contain a digest.
 - docker-daemon:docker-reference An image docker-reference stored in the docker
   daemon internal storage. docker-reference must contain either a tag or a
   digest. Alternatively, when reading images, the format can also be
   docker-daemon:algo:digest (an image ID).
 - oci:path:tag An image tag in a directory compliant with "Open Container Image
   Layout Specification" at path.
