cat << EOF
libostree is both a shared library and suite of command line tools that combines
a "git-like" model for committing and downloading bootable filesystem trees,
along with a layer for deploying them and managing the bootloader configuration.
Features:
 - Transactional upgrades and rollback for the system
 - Replicating content incrementally over HTTP via GPG signatures and "pinned
   TLS" support
 - Support for parallel installing more than just 2 bootable roots
 - Binary history on the server side (and client)
 - Introspectable shared library API for build and deployment systems
 - Flexible support for multiple branches and repositories, supporting projects
   like flatpak which use libostree for applications, rather than hosts.
