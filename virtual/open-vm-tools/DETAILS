cat << EOF
The Open Virtual Machine Tools (open-vm-tools) are the
open source implementation of VMware Tools.
They are a set of guest operating system
virtualization components that enhance performance
and user experience of virtual machines.
As virtualization technology rapidly becomes
mainstream, each virtualization solution provider
implements their own set of tools and utilities to
supplement the guest virtual machine.
However, most of the implementations are
proprietary and are tied to a specific
virtualization platform.

With the Open Virtual Machine Tools project,
we are hoping to solve this and other related problems.
The tools are currently composed of kernel modules for
Linux and user-space programs for all VMware supported
Unix-like guest operating systems.
They provide several useful functions like:
* File transfer between a host and guest
* Improved memory management and network performance
  under virtualization
* General mechanisms and protocols for communication
  between host and guests and from guest to guest.
