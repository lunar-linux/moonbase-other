Bombadillo features a full terminal user interface, vim-like keybindings,
document pager, configurable settings, and a robust command selection.
Currently, Bombadillo supports the following protocols as first class citizens:
  gopher
  gemini
  finger
  local (a user’s file system)
Support for the following protocols is also available via integration with 3rd
party applications:
  telnet
    Links are opened in a telnet application run as a subprocess.
  http/https
    Web support is opt-in (turned off by default).
    Links can be opened in a user’s default web browser when in a graphical
    environment.
    Web pages can be rendered directly in Bombadillo if Lynx, w3m, or elinks
    are installed on the system to handle the document parsing.
