cat << EOF
This moudule downloads the current version of Chromium for Linux to extract the pepperflash library
and other required files. It does not install Chromium.

Adobe has stopped maitaining flash for linux except for security updates. This means the current Linux
version, 11.x will not have any new functionality nor will it have other changes needed to operate
correctly as the underlying operating system improves.

Google and Adobe have teamed up to make their newer version of flash function under Googles Chromium browser.
Unfortuneatly this leaves the rest of the Linux broswers hanging out to dry. The purpose of this module
is to be a hard dependency for the freshplayerplugin.

To know more simply google search terms like "pepperflash" and/or "freshplayerplugin".
