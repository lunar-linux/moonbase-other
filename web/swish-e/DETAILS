Swish-e is a fast, flexible, and free open source system for indexing
collections of Web pages or other files.  Swish-e is ideally suited for
collections of a million documents or smaller. Using the GNOME
libxml2 parser and a collection of filters, Swish-e can index plain
text, e-mail, PDF, HTML, XML, Microsoft&reg; Word/PowerPoint/Excel and
just about any file that can be converted to XML or HTML text. Swish-e
is also often used to supplement databases like the MySQL DBMS for
very fast full-text searching.
