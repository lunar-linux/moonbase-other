cat << EOF
Bitweaver is a free and open source web application framework and content 
management system. Its speed and power are ideal for large-scale community 
websites and corporate applications, but it is simple enough for non-technical
small site users to set up and administrate. It comes fully featured on install
but is modular and easy to extend.
