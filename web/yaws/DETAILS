Yaws is entirely written in Erlang furthermore it is a multithreaded
webserver where one Erlang light weight process is used to handle
each client.

The main advantages of yaws compared to other Web technologies are
performance and elegance. The performance comes from the underlying
Erlang system and its ability to handle concurrent processes in an
efficent way.
