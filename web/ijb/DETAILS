The Internet Junkbuster Proxy (TM) blocks unwanted banner ads and
protects your privacy from cookies and other threats. It's free
under the GPL. It works as a proxy that stands between your browser
and the Internet, checking every HTTP request for each resource
(including graphics) against a blockfile of URLs before sending
it over the Internet. It can be configured as a plain old
non-caching, non-blocking proxy as well.
