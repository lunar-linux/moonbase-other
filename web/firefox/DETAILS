Mozilla Firefox is the successor of Mozilla Firebird.

Firefox includes:
  * comprehensive popup controls to keep unwanted advertising off 
    your desktop
  * a tab browsing mode that lets you open several pages in a single
    window, allowing you to load links in the background without 
    leaving the page you're on
  * integrated Google search
  * industry leading accessibility with Find As You Type - find links
    and page text by simply typing
  * simplified privacy controls that let you cover your tracks more 
    effectively
  * a streamlined browser window that lets you see more of the page 
    than any other browser while at the same time being more 
    configurable
  * a large variety of free downloadable extensions and themes that
    add specific functionality and visual changes to the browser

------- NOTE -------
The Lunar version of Firefox has crypto enabled and uses only gtk+-2.
NOTHING ELSE IS CONFIGURED IN! No mail, irc, composer, gpg, calendar,
MathML, Javascript debugger, html code inspector, LDAP, help support.
If you want any of that use the regular mozilla module.
