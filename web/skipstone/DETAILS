SkipStone is a Gtk+ Web Browser that embeds Mozilla's
rendering component Gecko. It aims to be light and
fast with few dependencies.

SkipStone is currently under heavy development, but
its progressing quickly and coming along nicely. It
provides a nice and simple configurable interface,
bookmarks and all of the other mandantory browsing features.

Downloading is handled by SkipDownload by default,
a Gtk+ frontend to the famous web downloading utility
wget. However, if you prefer to use other download
utilities / managers, this option is configurable.

Mail and external url handlers are also handled by
external applications which can be configured to the users
choice, leaving SkipStone to do what it does best - browsing.
