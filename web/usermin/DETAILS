cat << EOF
Usermin is a web interface that can be used by any user on a Unix system
to easily perform tasks like reading mail, setting up SSH or configuring
mail forwarding. It can be thought of as a simplified version of Webmin
designed for use by normal users rather than system administrators.
Like Webmin, Usermin consists of a simple web server, and a number of
CGI programs which directly update user config files like ~/.cshrc and
~/.forward. The web server and all CGI programs are written in Perl
version 5, and use only the non-standard Authen::PAM perl module.
