cat << EOF
Libwww is a highly modular, general-purpose client side Web API
written in C for Unix and Windows (Win32).  It's well suited for both
small and large applications, like browser/editors, robots, batch
tools, etc.  Pluggable modules provided with libwww include complete
HTTP/1.1 (with caching, pipelining, PUT, POST, Digest Authentication,
deflate, etc), MySQL logging, FTP, HTML/4, XML (expat), RDF (SiRPAC),
WebDAV, and much more.  The purpose of libwww is to serve as a testbed
for protocol experiments.
