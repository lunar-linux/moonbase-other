Google Gadgets for Linux provides a platform for running desktop gadgets under
Linux, catering to the unique needs of Linux users. It's compatible with the
gadgets written for Google Desktop for Windows as well as the Universal Gadgets
on iGoogle. Following Linux norms, this project is open-sourced under the
Apache License.

An important area where Google Desktop for Linux is different from its siblings
on other operating systems is support for gadgets. Now, the Linux version of
Google Gadgets will extend the gadgets platform to Linux users. By enabling
cross-platform gadgets, a large library of existing gadgets are immediately
available to Linux users. In addition, gadget developers will benefit from a
much larger potential user base without having to learn a new API.

There's two main components to the application: one is a common gadget library
responsible for running and presenting a gadget, and the other is a host program
that allows the user to choose gadgets and run them on the desktop. Currently we
have hosts written for GTK+ and QT, with the GTK+ host offering a sidebar
similar to that of Google Desktop for Windows.
