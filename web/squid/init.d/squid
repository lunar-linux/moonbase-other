# description: Squid - Internet Object Cache. Internet object caching is \
#       a way to store requested Internet objects (i.e., data available \
#       via the HTTP, FTP, and gopher protocols) on a system closer to the \
#       requesting site than to the source. Web browsers can then use the \
#       local Squid cache as a proxy HTTP server, reducing access time as \
#       well as bandwidth consumption.
