netdata is a highly optimized Linux daemon providing real-time performance
monitoring for Linux systems, Applications, SNMP devices, over the web.
It tries to visualize the truth of now, in its greatest detail, so that you
can get insights of what is happening now and what just happened, on your
systems and applications.
This is what you get:
 - Stunning bootstrap dashboards, out of the box (themable: dark, light)
 - Blazingly fast and super efficient, mostly written in C
 - Zero configuration - you just install it and it autodetects everything
 - Zero dependencies, it is its own web server for its static web files
 - Zero maintenance, you just run it, it does the rest
 - Custom dashboards that can be built using simple HTML (no javascript needed)
 - Extensible, you can monitor anything you can get a metric for
 - Embeddable, it can run anywhere a Linux kernel runs and its charts can be
   embedded on your web pages too.

After the daemon has been started for the first time, (with 'netdata' command)
download the default config file from http://127.0.0.1:19999/netdata.conf
Copy it to /etc/netdata/ and modify it.
