Teletekst is a european system that embeds textual information in the PAL
TV signal. Most european channels use this system to provide up to date
information on TV shows, video recorder start signals, the latest news and
hundreds of pages (with 40x25 characters) of information.

The dutch national public TV stations have an internet link to these pages.
This program can query them online.
