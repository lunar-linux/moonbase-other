WebKitGTK+ is a web content engine, derived from KHTML and KJS from KDE,
and used primarily in Apple's Safari browser. It is made to be embedded
in other applications, such as mail readers, or web browsers.

It is able to display content such as HTML, SVG, XML, and others. It
also supports DOM, XMLHttpRequest, XSLT, CSS, Javascript/ECMAscript
and more.
