Mozilla is a Web browser that is being developed by the Free Software
Community with the cooperation and support of Netscape. Initially, its
development was based on an early version of Netscape Communicator 5.0.
But most of it was disposed of halfway, and the current Mozilla is a
completely new software based on the "NGLayout" layout engine developed
for Netscape Communicator 6.
