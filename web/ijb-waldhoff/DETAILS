The Internet Junkbuster Proxy (TM) blocks unwanted banner ads and
protects your privacy from cookies and other threats. It's free
under the GPL. It works as a proxy that stands between your browser
and the Internet, checking every HTTP request for each resource
(including graphics) against a blockfile of URLs before sending
it over the Internet. It can be configured as a plain old
non-caching, non-blocking proxy as well.
Note that this versions is not the original version, but an
enhanced that replaces the ads with a transparent 1x1 gif.
