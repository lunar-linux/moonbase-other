A SOAP implementation for Python

SOAP is a lightweight protocol for exchange of information in a decentralized,
distributed environment. It is an XML based protocol that consists of three
parts: an envelope that defines a framework for describing what is in a message
and how to process it, a set of encoding rules for expressing instances of
application-defined datatypes, and a convention for representing remote
procedure calls and responses. SOAP can potentially be used in combination
with a variety of other protocols; however, the only bindings defined in this
document describe how to use SOAP in combination with HTTP and HTTP Extension
Framework.
