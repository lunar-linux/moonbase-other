cclive is a lightweight command-line video extraction tool for YouTube
and other similar video websites. It is a rewrite of the clive software
in C++, with a lower system footprint and fewer dependencies.

cclive is primarily a "video download tool", but it can also be used
with video player software, like "mplayer", for viewing streamed videos
instead of the Adobe Flash player.

View the supported websites with:  cclive --support
