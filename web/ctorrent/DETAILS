cat << EOF
CTorrent is a BitTorrent Client program by C for FreeBSD and Linux.
Fast and small are CTorrent's two strengths. Since CTorrent has been abandoned
by the original dev, this Enhanced CTorrent was forked, so I updated this
module in moonbase to use the enhanced fork.

The purpose of the Enhanced CTorrent effort is to fix problems that remain in
the code, modernize existing features and algorithms, and implement new
features while maintaining low overhead requirements and a high standard of
performance (both part of the original CTorrent design philosophy). Highlights
of the enhanced client include:

   * Support for large files (>2GB) and large torrents (>255 files)
   * Strategic selection of pieces to request for download
   * Continuous queueing of download requests, tuned based on latency and throughput for each peer
   * Improved download performance, including parallel requests in initial and endgame modes
   * Improved bandwidth regulation
   * Improved compatibility with other peers
   * Performance optimization and bug fixes
   * An interface for monitoring and managing multiple clients
