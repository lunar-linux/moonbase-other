Screem is a website development environment.  Its purpose is to increase
productivity when constructing a web site by providing quick access to 
commonly used features of web sites (such as tables).  It is written for
use with the GNOME desktop environment.  Unlike most other website/HTML
editors screem does not provide a WYSIWYG display of the page, but
instead just gives you the raw HTML source code in its editor window.
