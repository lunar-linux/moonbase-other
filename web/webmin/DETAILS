Webmin is a web-based interface for system administration for Unix. Using any
browser that supports tables and forms (and Java for the File Manager module),
you can setup user accounts, Apache, DNS, file sharing and so on.

Webmin consists of a simple web server, and a number of CGI programs which
directly update system files like /etc/inetd.conf and /etc/passwd. The web
server and all CGI programs are written in Perl version 5, and use no
non-standard Perl modules.
