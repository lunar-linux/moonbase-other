Varnish is a state-of-the-art, high-performance HTTP accelerator. It uses the 
advanced features in Linux 2.6, FreeBSD 6/7 and Solaris 10 to achieve its 
high performance.

Some of the features include

    * A modern design
    * VCL - a very flexible configuration language
    * Load balancing with health checking of backends
    * Partial support for ESI
    * URL rewriting
    * Graceful handling of "dead" backends
