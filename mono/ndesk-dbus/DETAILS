cat << EOF
ndesk-dbus is a C# implementation of D-Bus. It's often referred to as
dbus-sharp, or "managed D-Bus". It provides a tested, high-performance
bridge to and from all systems that are exposed via D-Bus, regardless
of programming language, UI toolkit or license.
D-Bus is an inter-process communication framework that lets applications
interface with the system event bus as well as allowing them to talk to
one another in a peer-to-peer configuration.
