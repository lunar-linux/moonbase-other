Mono.Zeroconf is a cross platform Zero Configuration Networking library
for Mono and .NET. It provides a unified API for performing the most
common zeroconf operations on a variety of platforms and subsystems.

Developers can publish services that will be exposed to other computers
on the network and also query the local machines on the network for
services that could have been exposed.

Please note that avahi needs to be built with mono support for the
avahi-sharp library to be found, a requirement for this package.
