cat << EOF
Qtella is a client for the Gnet with many useful features. It is 
written in C++, uses the Qt libraries, and is available for Linux. 
Qtella's advantages over other clients include the fact that it is 
very fast (since it uses C++ instead of Java), it available for 
multiple platforms (since it uses Qt), and it is not spyware.
