cat << EOF
Why write another unit converter? There are plenty of them out there. Well, I
couldn't find one that worked quite the way I wanted.

With ConvertAll, you can combine the units any way you want. If you want to
convert from inches per decade, that's fine. Or from meter-pounds. Or from
cubic nautical miles. The units don't have to make sense to anyone else.
