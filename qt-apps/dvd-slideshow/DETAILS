dvd-slideshow makes a DVD-compatible slideshow video with menus from a batch of
pictures. It consists of a set of scripts: dvd-slideshow reads a text file list
of all the pictures you want in one slideshow and creates a DVD-compatible MPEG
movie with your audio tracks and specified timing. It supports effects such as
fades, crops, and the Ken Burns effect. dvd-menu makes a top-level DVD menu with
the output files from dvd-slideshow. dir2slideshow makes a dvd-slideshow input
file from a directory of pictures.
