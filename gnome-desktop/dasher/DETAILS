Dasher is an information-efficient text-entry interface, driven by 
natural continuous pointing gestures. Dasher is a competitive text-entry 
system wherever a full-size keyboard cannot be used - for example,

    * on a palmtop computer;
    * on a wearable computer;
    * when operating a computer one-handed, by joystick, touchscreen, trackball, or mouse;
    * when operating a computer with zero hands (i.e., by head-mouse or by eyetracker). 

The eyetracking version of Dasher allows an experienced user to write 
text as fast as normal handwriting - 25 words per minute; using a mouse, 
experienced users can write at 39 words per minute.
