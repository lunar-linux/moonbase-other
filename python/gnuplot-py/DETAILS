Gnuplot.py is a Python package that interfaces to gnuplot, the popular
open-source plotting program. It allows you to use gnuplot from within
Python to plot arrays of data from memory, data files, or mathematical
functions. If you use Python to perform computations or as 'glue'
for numerical programs, you can use this package to plot data on the
fly as they are computed. And the combination with Python makes it
is easy to automate things, including to create crude 'animations'
by plotting different datasets one after another.
