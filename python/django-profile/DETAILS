cat << EOF
This is a Django pluggable user profile zone which can be used and
customized easily in your social application web platform developed
in django.

It's developed with Django for the backend framework and uses JQuery
as the javascript library for the client UI. It avoids big amounts of
development time process in such a generic thing as the User Profile
and account utilities.
