Pylint is a python tool that checks if a module satisfies a coding standard.
It can be seen as another PyChecker since nearly all tests you can do with
PyChecker can also be done with Pylint. But Pylint offers some more features,
like checking line-code's length, checking if variable names are well-formed
according to your coding standard, or checking of declared interfaces are
truly implemented, and much more.

The big advantage of Pylint is that it is highly configurable, customizable,
and you can easily write a small plugin to add a personal feature.
