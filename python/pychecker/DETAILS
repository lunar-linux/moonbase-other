cat << EOF
PyChecker is a tool for finding bugs in python source code. It finds
problems that are typically caught by a compiler for less dynamic
languages, like C and C++. It is similar to lint. Because of the dynamic
nature of python, some warnings may be incorrect; however, spurious
warnings should be fairly infrequent.
