open-source implementations of the Web Application Messaging Protocol (WAMP) for a range
of languages (as well as the industry-standard WebSocket test suite).

WAMP connects components in distributed applications using Publish and Subscribe (PubSub)
and routed Remote Procedure Calls (rRPC). It is ideal for distributed, multi-client and server
applications such as IoT applications or multi-user database-driven business applications.
