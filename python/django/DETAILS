Django is a high-level Python Web framework that encourages rapid
development and clean, pragmatic design.

Developed four years ago by a fast-moving online-news operation, Django
was designed to handle two challenges: the intensive deadlines of a 
newsroom and the stringent requirements of the experienced Web 
developers who wrote it. It lets you build high-performing, elegant Web
applications quickly.

Django focuses on automating as much as possible and adhering to the DRY
principle.
