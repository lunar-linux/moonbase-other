           SHORT="A fully functional X client library for Python programs"

cat << EOF
The Python X Library is intended to be a fully functional X client library for
Python programs. It is written entirely in Python, in contrast to earlier X
libraries for Python (the ancient X extension and the newer plxlib) which were
interfaces to the C Xlib.
There are three advantages of implementing a pure Python library:
 - Integration: The library can make use of the wonderful object system in
   Python, providing an easy-to-use class hierarchy.
 - Portability: The library will be usable on (almost) any computer which have
   Python installed. A C interface could be problematic to port to non-Unix
   systems, such as MS Windows or OpenVMS.
 - Maintainability: It is much easier to develop and debug native Python modules
   than modules written in C.
