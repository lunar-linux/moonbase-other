cat <<EOF
urlgrabber is a pure Python package that drastically simplifies the
fetching of files. It is designed to be used in programs that need
common (but not necessarily simple) url-fetching features. It is
extremely simple to drop into an existing program and provides a
clean interface to protocol-independant file-access. Best of all,
urlgrabber takes care of all those pesky file-fetching details, and
lets you focus on whatever it is that your program is written to do!
