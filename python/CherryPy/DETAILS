CherryPy allows developers to build web applications in much the same
way they would build any other object-oriented Python program. This
results in smaller source code developed in less time.
CherryPy is now more than six years old and it is has proven very fast
and stable. It is being used in production by many sites, from the
simplest ones to the most demanding ones.
The WSGI server that comes bundled with CherryPy is available as a
standalone module in wsgiserver/__init__.py
