cat << EOF
Piston is a relatively small Django application that lets you
create application programming interfaces (API) for your sites.

It has several unique features:

    * Ties into Django's internal mechanisms.
    * Supports OAuth out of the box (as well as Basic/Digest or custom
      auth.)
    * Doesn't require tying to models, allowing arbitrary resources.
    * Speaks JSON, YAML, Python Pickle & XML (and HATEOAS.)
    * Ships with a convenient reusable library in Python
    * Respects and encourages proper use of HTTP (status codes, ...)
    * Has built in (optional) form validation (via Django), throttling,
      etc.
    * Supports streaming, with a small memory footprint.
    * Stays out of your way.
