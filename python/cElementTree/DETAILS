cat << EOF
The cElementTree module is a C implementation of the ElementTree API, optimized
for fast parsing and low memory use. On typical documents, cElementTree is
15-20 times faster than the Python version of ElementTree, and uses 2-5 times
less memory. On modern hardware, that means that documents in the 50-100
megabyte range can be manipulated in memory, and that documents in the 0-1
megabyte range load in zero time (0.0 seconds). This allows you to drastically
simplify many kinds of XML applications.
