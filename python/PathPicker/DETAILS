PathPicker is a simple command line tool that solves the perpetual problem of
selecting files out of bash output. PathPicker will:
 - Parse all incoming lines for entries that look like files
 - Present the piped input in a convenient selector UI
 - Allow you to either:
 - Edit the selected files in your favorite $EDITOR
 - Execute an arbitrary command with them.
The installed script is named 'fpp'.
