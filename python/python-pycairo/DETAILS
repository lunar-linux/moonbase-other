           SHORT="Python bindings for the cairo graphics library"

cat << EOF
Pycairo is a Python module providing bindings for the cairo graphics library.
The Pycairo bindings are designed to match the cairo C API as closely as
possible, and to deviate only in cases which are clearly better implemented in
a more ‘Pythonic’ way.
