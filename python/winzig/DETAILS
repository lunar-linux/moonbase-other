It was designed with small code size and small screen real estate in mind so
that it can be run on a PDA if necessary. A simple database engine provides a
common infrastructure and a high level of configurability.

The following applications are available:
 * Addressbook
 * Calculator
 * Calendar
 * Todolist
 * Ascii/Unicode table viewer
 * Notebook
 * Weather Station (using data from weather.noaa.gov)
 * X11 color viewer (Linux/BSD only)
 * Clock (only standalone)

All applications are standalone and can be invoked directly or from the winzig
shell.
