cat << EOF
Sphinx is a tool that makes it easy to create intelligent and beautiful 
documentation for Python projects (or other documents consisting of 
multiple reStructuredText sources), written by Georg Brandl. It was 
originally created for the new Python documentation, and has excellent 
facilities for Python project documentation, but C/C++ is supported as 
well, and more languages are planned.
