Sphinx is a tool that makes it easy to create intelligent and beautiful
documentation for Python projects (or other documents consisting of multiple
reStructuredText sources), written by Georg Brandl. It was originally created
for the new Python documentation, and has excellentfacilities for Python
project documentation, but C/C++ is supported as well, and more languages are
planned.
