cat << EOF
Tornado is a Python web framework and asynchronous
networking library, originally developed at FriendFeed.
By using non-blocking network I/O, Tornado can scale
to tens of thousands of open connections, making it
ideal for long polling, WebSockets, and other
applications that require a long-lived
connection to each user.
