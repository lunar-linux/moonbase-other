This library is used to gain direct access to the functions exposed by Daniel J. Bernstein
nacl library via libsodium or tweetnacl. It has been constructed to maintain extensive
documentation on how to use nacl as well as being completely portable. The file in
libnacl/__init__.py can be pulled out and placed directly in any project to give a single
file binding to all of nacl.
