cat << EOF
Cheetah3 is a free and open source template engine and code-generation tool
written in Python. Cheetah can be used unto itself, or incorporated with other
technologies and stacks regardless of whether they're written in Python or not.
At its core, Cheetah is a domain-specific language for markup generation and
templating which allows for full integration with existing Python code but also
offers extensions to traditional Python syntax to allow for easier
text-generation.
