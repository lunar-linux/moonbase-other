cat << EOF
IPython is a free software project (released under the GNU LGPL) which tries to:
1. Provide an interactive shell superior to Python's default. IPython has many
   features for object introspection, system shell access, and its own special
   command system for adding functionality when working interactively. It tries
   to be a very efficient environment both for Python code development and for
   exploration of problems using Python objects (in situations like data
   analysis).
2. Serve as an embeddable, ready to use interpreter for your own programs.
   IPython can be started with a single call from inside another program,
   providing access to the current namespace. This can be very useful both for
   debugging purposes and for situations where a blend of batch-processing and
   interactive exploration are needed.
3. Offer a flexible framework which can be used as the base environment for
   other systems with Python as the underlying language. Specifically scientific
   environments like Mathematica, IDL and Mathcad inspired its design, but
   similar ideas can be useful in many fields.
