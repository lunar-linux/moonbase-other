           SHORT="An enhanced Interactive Python shell"

cat << EOF
IPython is a free software project (released under the GNU LGPL) which tries to:
1. Provide an interactive shell superior to Python's default. IPython
   has many features for object introspection, system shell access,
   and its own special command system for adding functionality when
   working interactively. It tries to be a very efficient environment
   both for Python code development and for exploration of problems
   using Python objects (in situations like data analysis).
2. Serve as an embeddable, ready to use interpreter for your own
   programs. IPython can be started with a single call from inside
   another program, providing access to the current namespace. This can
   be very useful both for debugging purposes and for situations where
   a blend of batch-processing and interactive exploration are needed.
3. Offer a flexible framework which can be used as the base
   environment for other systems with Python as the underlying
   language. Specifically scientific environments like Mathematica,
   IDL and Mathcad inspired its design, but similar ideas can be useful
   in many fields.
