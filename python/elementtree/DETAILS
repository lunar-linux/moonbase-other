cat << EOF
The Element type is a simple but flexible container object, designed to store
hierarchical data structures, such as simplified XML infosets, in memory. The
element type can be described as a cross between a Python list and a Python
dictionary.

The ElementTree wrapper adds code to load XML files as trees of Element
objects, and save them back again.
