ScientificPython is a collection of Python modules that are useful for 
scientific computing. In this collection you will find modules that 
cover basic geometry (vectors, tensors, transformations, vector and 
tensor fields), quaternions, automatic derivatives, (linear) 
interpolation, polynomials, elementary statistics, nonlinear 
least-squares fits, unit calculations, Fortran-compatible text 
formatting, 3D visualization via VRML, and two Tk widgets for simple 
line plots and 3D wireframe models. There are also interfaces to the 
netCDF library (portable structured binary files), to MPI (Message 
Passing Interface, message-based parallel programming), and to BSPlib 
(Bulk Synchronous Parallel programming). For details consult the manual.
