cat << EOF
This is the home of Pygments. It is a generic syntax highlighter for
general use in all kinds of software such as forum systems, wikis or
other applications that need to prettify source code. Highlights are:
    * a wide range of common languages and markup formats is supported
    * special attention is paid to details that increase highlighting
      quality
    * support for new languages and formats are added easily; most 
      languages use a simple regex-based lexing mechanism
    * a number of output formats is available, among them HTML, RTF, 
      LaTeX and ANSI sequences
    * it is usable as a command-line tool and as a library
    * ... and it highlights even Brainf*ck!
