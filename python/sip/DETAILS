cat << EOF
SIP is a tool that makes it very easy to create Python bindings for C++
libraries. It was originally developed to create PyQt, the Python
bindings for the Qt toolkit, but can be used to create bindings for any
C++ library.
SIP comprises a code generator and a Python module. The code generator
processes a set of specification files and generates C++ code which is
then compiled to create the bindings extension module. The SIP Python
module provides support functions to the automatically generated code.
