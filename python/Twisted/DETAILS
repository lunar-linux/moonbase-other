cat << EOF
Twisted is a framework, written in Python, for writing networked
applications. It includes implementations of a number of commonly
used network services such as a web server, an IRC chat server,
a mail server, a relational database interface and an object broker.

Developers can build applications using all of these services as well
as custom services that they write themselves. Twisted also includes
a user authentication system that controls access to services and
provides services with user context information to implement their
own security models.
