cat << EOF
gst-plugins-ugly is a set of plug-ins for GStreamer 1.x that have good quality
and correct functionality, but distributing them might pose problems.
The license on either the plug-ins or the supporting libraries might not be how
we'd like. The code might be widely known to present patent problems, such as
MP3.
