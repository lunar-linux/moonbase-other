cat << EOF
polypaudio is a sound server for Linux and other Unix like operating systems. 
It is intended to be an improved drop-in replacement for the Enlightened Sound Daemon (ESOUND). 
It is my ultimate ambition to get Polypaudio into Gnome as a replacement for ESOUND. 
In addition to the features ESOUND provides polypaudio has:

Extensible plugin architecture (by loading dynamic loadable modules with dlopen())
Support for more than one sink/source
Better low latency behaviour
Embedabble into other software (the core is available as C library)
Completely asynchronous C API
Simple command line interface for reconfiguring the daemon while running
Flexible, implicit sample type conversion and resampling
"Zero-Copy" architecture
Module autoloading
Very accurate latency measurement for playback and recordin.
May be used to combine multiple sound cards to one (with sample rate adjustment)
Client side latency interpolation
