AWESFX is the package of various utility programs for controlling
EMU8K/EMU10Kx.  It includes the soundfont loader (sfxload for OSS,
asfxload for ALSA), chorus/reverb effect loader (setfx), Gravis patch
loader (gusload), control parameter set up (aweset), and SF-Text
conversion programs, and so on.  EMU8K processor is wavetable part of
SoundBlaster 32/AWE32 sound cards.  EMU10Kx processor is heart of
SoundBlaster 512/Live!/Audigy series.  There are some other sound
cards that use EMU8K processor but there is no RAM onboard so
soundfont loading is not possible.

This utility package requires kernel built with ALSA or OSS driver.

There is no any soundfont files included with this package. Soundfonts
(*.sf2) files can be found on Creative Driver CD or the Internet.
