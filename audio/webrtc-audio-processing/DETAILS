cat << EOF
This is meant to be a more Linux packaging friendly copy of the AudioProcessing
module from the WebRTC[1] project. The ideal case is that we make no changes to
the code to make tracking upstream code easy.

This package currently only includes the AudioProcessing bits, but I am very
open to collaborating with other projects that wish to distribute other bits of
the code and hopefully eventually have a single point of packaging all the
WebRTC code to help people reuse the code and avoid keeping private copies in
several different projects.
