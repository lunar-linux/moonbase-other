Accordeur is a program designed to help you to tune
your musical instrument. It is derived from Dan's Tuner.
Essential differences are :
- It displays the analysed spectrum.

- For low pitches it changes number of samples,
  so low pitch notes are well analysed.

- Fine compute of the pitch is made by parabolic,
  not cubic interpolation.
