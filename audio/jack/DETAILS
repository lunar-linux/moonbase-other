cat << EOF
JACK is a low-latency audio server, written primarily for the Linux
operating system. It can connect a number of different applications to
an audio device, as well as allowing them to share audio between
themselves. Its clients can run in their own processes (ie. as a normal
application), or can they can run within a JACK server (ie. as a
plugin).
