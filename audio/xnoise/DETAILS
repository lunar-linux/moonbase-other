XNOISE is a media player for Gtk+ with a slick GUI, great speed and 
lots of features.

Xnoise uses a tracklist centric design. The tracklist is a list of 
video or music tracks that are played one by one without being removed 
(right side of window). This gives you the possibility to queue any track in any order, regardless if they are on the same album. Tracks or groups of tracks can be reordered at any time via drag and drop.
