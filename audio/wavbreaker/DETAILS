cat << EOF
This application's purpose in life is to take a wave file and break
it up into multiple wave files. It makes a clean break at the correct
position to burn the files to an audio cd without any dead air between
the tracks. It will only read wave files, so use an appropriate tool to
convert ogg, mp3, etc. files and then break them up.
