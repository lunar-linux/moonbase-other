	    SHORT="A tool to split a wave file up into multiple waves"

cat << EOF
This application's purpose in life is to take a wave file and break 
it up into multiple wave files. It makes a clean break at the correct 
position to burn the files to an audio cd without any dead air between 
the tracks. It will only read wave files, so use an appropriate tool to 
convert ogg, mp3, etc. files and then break them up.
