AdPlay is a free, hardware independent FM synth music player,
mainly written in C++ and released under the LGPL.
AdPlay plays sound data, originally created for
the AdLib (OPL2) and Sound Blaster (Dual OPL2/OPL3) audio boards,
directly from its original format on top of an emulator or
by using the real hardware. No OPL chip is required for playback.
