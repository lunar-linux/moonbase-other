mhWaveEdit is a graphical program for editing,
playing and recording sound files. It is lightweight,
portable, user-friendly and handles large files very well.

The program itself has only simple editing features
such as cut'n'paste and volume adjustment but it can
also use Ladspa effect plugins and the effects provided
by the SoX application. It can also support additional
file formats besides wav through libsndfile and mp3/ogg
import and export through lame and oggenc/oggdec.
