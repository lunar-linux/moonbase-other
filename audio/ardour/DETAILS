cat << EOF
Ardour is a multichannel hard disk recorder (HDR) and digital audio
workstation (DAW). It is capable of simultaneous recording 24 or more
channels of 32 bit audio at 48kHz. Ardour is intended to function as a
professional HDR system, replacing dedicated hardware solutions such
as the Mackie HDR, the Tascam 2424 and more traditional tape systems
like the Alesis ADAT series. It is also intended to provide the same or
better functionality as software systems such as ProTools, Samplitude,
Logic Audio, Nuendo and Cubase VST (we acknowledge these and all other
names as trademarks of their respective owners). It supports MIDI
Machine Control, and so can be controlled from any MMC controller, such
as the Mackie Digital 8 Bus mixer and many other modern digital mixers.
