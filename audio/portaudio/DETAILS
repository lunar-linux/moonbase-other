PortAudio is a free, cross platform, open-source, audio I/O library. It lets you
write simple audio programs in 'C' that will compile and run on many platforms
including Windows, Macintosh (8,9,X), Unix (OSS), SGI, and BeOS. PortAudio is
intended to promote the exchange of audio synthesis software between developers
on different platforms.

PortAudio provides a very simple API for recording and/or playing sound using a
simple callback function.  Example programs are included that synthesize sine
waves and pink noise, perform fuzz distortion on a guitar, list available audio
devices, etc.
