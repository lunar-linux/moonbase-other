cat << EOF
gst-plugins-ugly is a set of plug-ins for GStreamer 1.x that have
good quality and correct functionality, but distributing them might
pose problems.  The license on either the plug-ins or the supporting
libraries might not be how we'd like. The code might be widely known
to present patent problems, such as MP3.
