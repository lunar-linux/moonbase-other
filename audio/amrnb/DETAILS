cat << EOF
This is a home page or amrnb and amrwb libraries, based on the reference
implementation. I created it to prevent ugly embedding of the same code
to many Open Source projects and to maintain patches and fixes for it.

3GPP released reference implementations 3GPP Adaptive Multi-Rate
Floating-point (AMR) Speech Codec (3GPP TS 26.104 V 7.0.0) and 3GPP AMR
Adaptive Multi-Rate - Wideband (AMR-WB) Speech Codec (3GPP TS 26.204 V7.0.0).

Reference implementations are available as a source code, but the code uses
a define to choose code options. There is a common practice to compile
reusable code as a shared library. Packages released here make required changes
and provide AMR libraries as a shareable code. They provide exactly the same
API, but some calls are wrapped by macros to call proper variant of the
function.

Please note, that this wrapper does not fix any bugs of original code,
especially it does not fix known crashes on input files with different format
than expected. I will accept patches for them, if 3GPP will not release fixed
implementation.
