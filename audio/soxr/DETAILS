cat << EOF
The SoX Resampler library `libsoxr' performs one-dimensional sample-rate conversions, 
it may be used, for example, to resample PCM-encoded audio.

It aims to give fast and high quality results for any constant (rational or irrational) 
resampling ratio. Phase-response, preserved bandwidth, aliasing, and rejection level 
parameters are all configurable; alternatively, simple `preset' configurations may be 
selected. An experimental, variable-rate resampling mode of operation is also included.
