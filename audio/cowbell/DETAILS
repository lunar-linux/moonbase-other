Cowbell is an elegant, album-based, music organizer written in C# for
Gtk+. Using TagLib, it supports many audio formats.

Cowbell is tightly integrated with Amazon.com using its free SOAP
service.  Cowbell employs this service not only to fetch album cover
images, as most tag editors do, but also in combination with
intelligent algorithms to "guess" the appropriate song information
from song titles.
