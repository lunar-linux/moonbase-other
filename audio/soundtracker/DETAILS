SoundTracker is a music tracking tool for Unix / X11 similar in design to the
DOS program FastTracker and the Amiga legend ProTracker. Samples can be lined
up on tracks and patterns which are then arranged to a song. Supported module
formats are XM and MOD; the player code is the one from OpenCP. A basic sample
recorder and editor is also included. SoundTracker is free ("open source")
software, licensed under the GNU GPL.
