Seq24 is a minimal loop based midi sequencer for linux.
It was created to provide a very simple interface for editing and playing midi
'loops'. After searching for a software based sequencer that would provide the
functionality needed for a live performance, such as the Akai MPC line, the
Kawai Q80 sequencer, or the popular Alesis MMT-8, I found nothing similar in
the software realm. I set out to create a very minimal sequencer that excludes
the bloated features of the large software sequencers, and includes a small
subset of features that I have found usable in performing.
