Clamz is a little command-line program to download MP3 files from Amazon.com's 
music store. It is intended to serve as a substitute for Amazon's official MP3 
Downloader, which is not free software (and therefore is only available in 
binary form for a limited set of platforms.) Clamz can be used to download 
either individual songs or complete albums that you have purchased from Amazon.
