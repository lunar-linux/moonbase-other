cat << EOF
This is release OpenAL library which is hardware accelerated on
genuine Creative Sound Blaster Live!/Audigy sound cards.
This means this library will not work on any other sound cards
than mentioned. Beware of 'fake' Audigy/Live! sound cards that do not
have EMU10K chip - they will not work however they are branded as Live!/Audigy.
Examples of such 'fake' cards are Live! 24bit and Audigy SE.
