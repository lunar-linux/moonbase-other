Music Player Daemon (MPD) allows remote access for playing music (MP3,
Ogg Vorbis, FLAC, AAC, Mod, and wave files) and managing playlists.
MPD is designed for integrating a computer into a stereo system that
provides control for music playback over a local network. It also
makes a great desktop music player, especially if you are a console
junkie, like frontend options, or restart X often.
