Music Player Daemon (MPD) allows remote access for playing music (MP3, Ogg
Vorbis, FLAC, AAC, Mod, and wave files) and managing playlists.
MPD is designed for integrating a computer into a stereo system that provides
control for music playback over a local network. It also makes a great desktop
music player, especially if you are a console junkie, like frontend options,
or restart X often.
