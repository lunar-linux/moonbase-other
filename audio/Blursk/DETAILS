From the web site
Blursk is a visualization plugin for the Linux XMMS MP3 player.
It was inspired by the "Blur Scope" plugin, but Blursk goes far beyond that.
It supports a wide variety of colormaps, blur patterns, plotting styles,
and other options.
The only things that haven't changed are portions of the XMMS interface
and configuration code.
