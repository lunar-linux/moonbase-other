Streamripper was started sometime back in early 2000. Streamripper
started as a way to separate tracks via Shoutcast's title-streaming
feature. This has now been expanded into a much more generic feature,
where part of the program only tries to "hint" at where one track
starts and another ends, thus allowing a mp3 decoding engine to scan
for a silent mark, which is used to find an exact track separation.
