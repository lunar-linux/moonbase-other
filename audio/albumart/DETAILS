cat << EOF
Here's a program that will semi-automatically download album cover images for
your music collection. All you have to do is point it at the root of your music
directory and for each directory, the program will download a set of
corresponding (well, best guess) album covers from the Internet, from which you
can choose one that suits your fancy.
Currently supports downloading from: Amazon.com, Yahoo Images, Wal-mart,
Buy.com,
