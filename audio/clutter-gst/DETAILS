cat << EOF
Clutter-GStreamer (clutter-gst) is an integration library for using GStreamer
with Clutter.

Clutter is an open source software library for creating fast, visually rich and
animated graphical user interfaces. It uses OpenGL for drawing primitives and
has multiple backends, allowing its usage on different platforms.

GStreamer is a streaming media framework, based on graphs of filters which
operate on media data. Applications using this library can do anything from
real-time sound processing to playing videos, and just about anything else
media-related.  Its plugin-based architecture means that new data types or
processing capabilities can be added simply by installing new plug-ins.
