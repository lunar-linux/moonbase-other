           SHORT="FAAD is an ISO AAC audio decoder"

cat << EOF
FAAD is the fastest ISO AAC audio decoder available. FAAD correctly decodes 
all MPEG-4 and MPEG-2 MAIN, LOW, LTP, LD and ER object type AAC files.
There is a stable version of FAAD available, source code can be downloaded 
on the download page. The advantage of this new library is the lack of
copyrighted code written by third parties. Further it is coded much cleaner 
and will give a much better understanding of the AAC coding algorithms.
