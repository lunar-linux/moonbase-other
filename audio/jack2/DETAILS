cat << EOF
JACK is a low-latency audio server, written primarily for the Linux operating
system. It can connect a number of different applications to an audio device,
as well as allowing them to share audio between themselves. Its clients can run
in their own processes (ie. as a normal application), or can they can run within
a JACK server (ie. as a plugin).
