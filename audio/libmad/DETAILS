Libmad is a high-quality MPEG audio decoder library. It currently supports
MPEG-1 and the MPEG-2  extension to Lower Sampling Frequencies, as well as
the so-called MPEG 2.5 format. All three audio layers (Layer I, Layer II,
and Layer III a.k.a. MP3) are fully implemented.  MAD has the following
special features:

* 24-bit PCM output
* 100% fixed-point (integer) computation
* completely new implementation based on the ISO/IEC standards
* distributed under the terms of the GNU General Public License (GPL)

Because libmad provides full 24-bit PCM output, applications using libmad
are able to produce high quality audio. Even when the output device
supports only 16-bit PCM, applications can use the extra resolution to
increase the audible dynamic range through the use of dithering or
noise shaping.
