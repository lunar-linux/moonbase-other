cat << EOF
gst-pulse is a GStreamer 0.10 plugin for the PulseAudio sound 
server.

It ist tested and works quite fine. The plugin is quite advanced 
as it includes both a sink and a source, and implements the 
GstMixer and GstPropertyProbe interfaces. Only the ALSA plugin 
shipped with upstream GStreamer is as advanced and featureful 
as gst-pulse.
