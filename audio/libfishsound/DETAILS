cat << EOF
libfishsound is a wrapper around the existing codec libraries and
provides a consistent, higher-level programming interface. It has been
designed for use in a wide variety of applications; it has no direct
dependencies on Ogg encapsulation, though it is most commonly used in
conjunction with liboggz to decode or encode FLAC, Speex or Vorbis audio
tracks in Ogg files, including Ogg Theora and Annodex.
