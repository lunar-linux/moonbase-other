cat << EOF
Raptor is a free software/Open Source C library that parses RDF syntaxes
such as RDF/XML and N-Triples into RDF triples.
Raptor was designed to work closely with the Redland RDF library (RDF 
Parser Toolkit for Redland) but is entirely separate. It is a portable 
library that works across many POSIX systems (Unix, GNU/Linux, BSDs, OSX, 
cygwin, win32). Raptor has no memory leaks and is fast.
