cat << EOF
Raptor is a free software/Open Source C library that parses RDF syntaxes
such as RDF/XML and N-Triples into RDF triples.

Raptor was designed to work closely with the Redland RDF library (RDF Parser
Toolkit for Redland) but is entirely separate. It is a portable library that
works across many POSIX systems (Unix, GNU/Linux, BSDs, OSX, cygwin, win32).
Raptor has no memory leaks and is fast.
