cat << EOF
Audioscrobbler is a computer system that builds up a detailed profile of
your musical taste. After installing an Audioscrobbler Plugin, your
computer sends the name of every song you play to the Audioscrobbler
Server.
With this information, the Audioscrobbler server builds you a 'Musical
Profile'. Statistics from your Musical Profile are shown on your
Audioscrobbler User Page, available for everyone to view.
