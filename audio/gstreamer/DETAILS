cat << EOF
GStreamer allows the construction of graphs of media-handling 
components, ranging from simple mp3 playback to complex audio (mixing) 
and video (non-linear editing) processing. Applications can take 
advantage of advances in codec and filter technology transparently. 
Developers can add new codecs and filters by writing a simple plugin 
with a clean, generic interface.
