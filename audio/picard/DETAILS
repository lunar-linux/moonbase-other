MusicBrainz Picard is a cross-platform (Linux/Mac OS X/Windows) application
written in Python and is the official MusicBrainz tagger. Picard supports the
majority of audio file formats, is capable of using audio fingerprints (PUIDs),
performing CD lookups and disc ID submissions, and it has excellent Unicode
support. Additionally, there are several plugins available that extend Picard's
features. When tagging files, Picard uses an album oriented approach. This
approach allows it to utilize the MusicBrainz data as effectively as possible
and correctly tag your music.
