cat << EOF
Exaile is a media player aiming to be similar to KDE's AmaroK, but for GTK+. It
incorporates many of the cool things from AmaroK (and other media players) like
automatic fetching of album art, handling of large libraries, lyrics fetching,
artist/album information via the wikipedia, last.fm support, optional iPod
support (assuming you have python-gpod installed).

In addition, Exaile also includes a built in shoutcast directory browser,
tabbed playlists (so you can have more than one playlist open at a time),
blacklisting of tracks (so they don't get scanned into your library),
downloading of guitar tablature from fretplay.com, and submitting played
tracks on your iPod to last.fm.
