AdPlug is a free, cross-platform, hardware independent
AdLib sound player library, mainly written in C++ and
released under the LGPL. AdPlug plays sound data,
originally created for the AdLib (OPL2) and
Sound Blaster (Dual OPL2/OPL3) audio boards,
directly from its original format on top of
an emulator or by using the real hardware.
No OPL chip is required for playback.
AdPlug itself is just the backend to
many different audio player frontends.
There is adplug-xmms plugin for popular audio player, XMMS,
as well as stand-alone adplay player for
many different systems available.
