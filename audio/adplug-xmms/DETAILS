AdPlug XMMS plugin is a free, cross-platform,
hardware independent AdLib sound player,
mainly written in C++ and released under the LGPL.
AdPlug XMMS plugin plays sound data,
originally created for the AdLib (OPL2) and
Sound Blaster (Dual OPL2/OPL3) audio boards,
directly from its original format on top of an emulator
or by using the real hardware. No OPL chip is required for playback.
