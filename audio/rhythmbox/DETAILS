iTunes application, an application that lets you do everything from
importing your audio cd's into mp3 or Ogg Vorbis format, and play
these music files and other music files you have. Play your music with
an assortment of visualization plugins and burn new audio cd's from
your music files. It is a one-stop shopping application for all your
music needs.
