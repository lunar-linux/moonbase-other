cat << EOF
AlsaPlayer is a new type of PCM player.
It is heavily multi-threaded and tries to excercise the
ALSA library and driver quite a bit. It has some very
interesting features unique to Linux/Unix players. The
goal is to create a fully pluggable framework for
playback of all sorts of media with the focus on PCM
audio data. The core code was written by Andy Lo-A-Foe
<andy at alsaplayer dot org> (or <arloafoe at cs dot
vu dot nl>) with contributions from many other folks.
See the credits files for details.
