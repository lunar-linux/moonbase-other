PulseAudio is a sound server for Linux and other Unix like operating
systems. It is intended to be an improved drop-in replacement for the
Enlightened Sound Daemon (ESOUND).
It is my ultimate ambition to get PulseAudio into Gnome as a
replacement for ESOUND. In addition to the features ESOUND provides
pulseaudio has:
  * Extensible plugin architecture (by loading dynamic loadable
    modules with dlopen())
  * Support for more than one sink/source
  * Better low latency behaviour
  * Embedabble into other software (the core is available as C library)
  * Completely asynchronous C API
  * Simple command line interface for reconfiguring the daemon
    while running
  * Flexible, implicit sample type conversion and resampling
  * "Zero-Copy" architecture
  * Module autoloading
  * Very accurate latency measurement for playback and recordin.
  * May be used to combine multiple sound cards to one (with sample
    rate adjustment)
  * Client side latency interpolation
