cat << EOF
SoundTouch is an open-source audio processing library for changing the Tempo,
Pitch and Playback Rates of audio streams or files:
    * Tempo (time-stretch): Changes the sound to play at faster or slower
    speed than original, without affecting the sound pitch.
    * Pitch (key) : Changes the sound pitch or key, without affecting the
    sound tempo or speed.
    * Playback Rate : Changes both the sound tempo and pitch, as if an LP
    disc was played at wrong RPM rate.
