Speex is an Open Source/Free Software  patent-free audio compression 
format designed for speech. The Speex Project aims to lower the barrier 
of entry for voice applications by providing a free alternative to 
expensive proprietary speech codecs. Moreover, Speex is well-adapted to 
Internet applications and provides useful features that are not present 
in most other codecs.
