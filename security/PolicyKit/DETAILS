PolicyKit is a toolkit for defining and handling the policy that allows
unprivileged processes to speak to privileged processes:
It is a framework for centralizing the decision making process
with respect to granting access to privileged operations for
unprivileged applications. PolicyKit is specifically targeting

operating systems.
