cat << EOF
TLS (aka SSL) Channel - can be layered on any bi-directional Tcl_Channel.

Both client and server-side sockets are possible, and this code should work
on any platform as it uses a generic mechanism for layering on SSL and Tcl.

TLS is an OpenSSL / RSA-bsafe Tcl extension that provides secure connections
on top of the Tcl socket mechanism. Within a few lines of code, users can query
https servers (see the tclhttpd project for an https server using TLS).

Needed by amsn.
