cat << EOF
Lynis is a security auditing for UNIX derivatives like Linux, Mac OS X, BSD, and
Solaris. It performs an in-depth security scan on the system itself, with the
goal to detect issues and provide tips for further system hardening. It will
also scan for general system information, vulnerable software packages, and
possible configuration issues.
