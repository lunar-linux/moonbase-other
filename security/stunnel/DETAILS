        SHORT="stunnel: multiplatform SSL tunneling proxy"

cat << EOF
The stunnel program is designed to work as an SSL encryption wrapper 
between remote client and local (inetd-startable) or remote server. 
It can be used to add SSL functionality to commonly used inetd daemons 
like POP2, POP3, and IMAP servers without any changes in the programs' 
code. Stunnel uses OpenSSL or SSLeay libraries for cryptography, so it 
supports whatever cryptographic algorithms you compiled into your library.
