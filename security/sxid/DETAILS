sXid is an all in one suid/sgid monitoring program designed to be run
from cron on a regular basis.  But can be run from the command line
just as well.  It tracks any changes in your s[u|g]id files and
folders.  If there are any new ones, ones that are not set anymore,
or they have changed bits or other modes then it reports the changes
in an easy to read formate via email or on the command line.
