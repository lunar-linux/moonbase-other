cat <<EOF
This is a PAM (Pluggable Authentication Modules) that only allows login from
certain hosts, either based on mac-address, ip-address, or their region looked
as up in internet registrar stats files. pam_ihosts is not an authentication
module, it's an account module.
This means that it comes into play only after a user has already authenticated,
and provides extra checks as to whether an authenticated user should be alowed
to log in. This allows fine-grained control of which hosts a user is allowed to
login from, with external logins being controlled by region and ip, and internal
networks being controlled by mac-address or ip, the former allowing control even
in DHCP environments. Both IP4 and IP6 are supported.
