cat << EOF
tinc is a Virtual Private Network (VPN) daemon that uses tunnelling and
encryption to create a secure private network between hosts on the Internet.
Because the VPN appears to the IP level network code as a normal network device,
there is no need to adapt any existing software. This allows VPN sites to share
information with each other over the Internet without exposing any information
to others. Features:

Encryption, authentication and compression
  All traffic is optionally compressed using zlib or LZO, and OpenSSL is used to
  encrypt the traffic and protect it from alteration with message authentication
  codes and sequence numbers.

Automatic full mesh routing
  Regardless of how you set up the tinc daemons to connect to each other, VPN
  traffic is always (if possible) sent directly to the destination, without going
  through intermediate hops.

Easily expand your VPN
  When you want to add nodes to your VPN, all you have to do is add an extra
  configuration file, there is no need to start new daemons or create and configure
  new devices or network interfaces.

Ability to bridge ethernet segments
  You can link multiple ethernet segments together to work like a single segment,
  allowing you to run applications and games that normally only work on a LAN over
  the Internet.

Runs on many operating systems and supports IPv6
