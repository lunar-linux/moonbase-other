cat << EOF
LogSentry (formerly Logcheck) automatically monitors your system logs
and mails security violations to you on a periodic basis. It is based
on a program that ships with the TIS Gauntlet firewall but has been
improved upon in many ways to make it work nicely for normal system
auditing.

Features

    * LogSentry helps in processing UNIX system logfiles generated by:

          * Psionic's PortSentry
          * Psionic's HostSentry
          * system daemons
          * Wietse Venema's TCP Wrapper and Log Daemon packages
          * Firewall Toolkit? by Trusted Information Systems?
            Inc.(TIS).

    * LogSentry also works very well at reporting on other common
      operating system security violations and strange events.
    * The latest version of LogSentry (version 1.1.1) is now covered
      by the GNU license.
