cat << EOF
Snort is a lightweight network intrusion detection system, capable
of performing real-time traffic analysis and packet logging on IP
networks. It can perform protocol analysis, content searching/matching
and can be used to detect a variety of attacks and probes, such as
buffer overflows, stealth port scans, CGI attacks, SMB probes, OS
fingerprinting attempts, and much more. Snort uses a flexible rule
based language to describe traffic that it should collect or pass, and
a modular detection engine. Snort has a real-time alerting capability,
with alert mechanisms for syslog, a user specified file, a UNIX socket,
or WinPopup messages to Windows clients using Samba's smbclient.

WARNING: the rules can only be downloaded by subscribers, or 30 days
after release by registered users. You may need to download manually.
