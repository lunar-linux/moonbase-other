Forgot your Windows admin password?

Overview:
 - This is a utility to reset the password of any user that has a valid local
   account on your Windows system.
 - Supports all Windows from NT3.5 to Win10, also 64 bit and also the Server
   versions (like 2003, 2008, 2012)
 - You do not need to know the old password to set a new one.
 - It works offline, that is, you have to shutdown your computer and boot off
   a CD or USB disk to do the password reset.
 - Will detect and offer to unlock locked or disabled out user accounts!
 - There is also a registry editor and other registry utilities that works
   under linux/unix, and can be used for other things than password editing.

The SAM file is in Windows/System32/Config directory on the Windows partition.
