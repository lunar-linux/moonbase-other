           SHORT="A PAM module that can mount volumes for a user session"

cat <<EOF
This module is aimed at environments with central file servers that a user
wishes to mount on login and unmount on logout, such as (semi-)diskless stations
where many users can logon and where statically mounting the entire /home from a
server is a security risk, or listing all possible volumes in /etc/fstab is not
feasible.

Users can define their own list of volumes without having to change (possibly
non-writable) global config files.
Single sign-on feature -- the user needs to type the password just once
Transparent mount process
No stored passwords
Volumes are unmounted on logout, freeing system resources and not leaving data
exposed.

The module also supports mounting local filesystems of any kind the normal mount
utility supports, with extra code to make sure certain volumes are set up
properly because often they need more than just a mount call, such as encrypted
volumes. This includes SMB/CIFS, NCP, FUSE, dm-crypt and LUKS.
