cat << EOF
This module is aimed at environments with SMB (Samba or Windows NT) or NCP
(Netware or Mars-NWE) servers that Unix users wish to access transparently.
It facilitates access to private volumes of these types well. The module als
supports mounting home directories using loopback encrypted filesystems. The
module was originally written for use on the GNU/Linux operating system but
has since been modified to work on several flavors of BSD.
