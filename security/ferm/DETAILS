           SHORT="A tool to maintain complex firewalls"

cat << EOF
FERM is a tool to maintain complex firewalls, without having the trouble
to rewrite the complex rules over and over again. FERM allows the entire
firewall rule set to be stored in a separate file, and to be loaded with
one command. The firewall configuration resembles structured
programming-like language, which can contain levels and lists.

Ferm is written in perl, so it requires perl5, and one of the kernel
firewall programs (ipchains/iptables/ipfwadm) to work, although you may
test firewall rule generation on any platform that supports perl.
