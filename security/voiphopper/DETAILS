cat << EOF
VoIP Hopper is a GPLv3 licensed security tool, written in C, that rapidly runs
a VLAN Hop into the Voice VLAN on specific Ethernet switches. VoIP Hopper
does this by mimicking the behavior of an IP Phone, in both Cisco and Avaya IP
Phone environments.

In Cisco IP Phone networks, it first dissects either IEEE 802.3 or Ethernet II
for Cisco Discovery Protocol (CDP) packets. If CDP is enabled on the switch
port and the Voice VLAN feature is enabled, it will determine the Voice VLAN ID
(VVID). This will allow the tool to create a new Ethernet interface on the PC
that tags the 802.1q VLAN header in the Ethernet packet. After VoIP Hopper has
created the new Ethernet device, it will send a DHCP client request.

In Avaya IP Phone environments, it sends an Option 55 parameter request list,
requesting Option 176. When the DHCP server sends Option 176, it decodes the
L2QVLAN reply field for the Voice VLAN ID. It then creates a new voice
interface and sends a DHCP request.
