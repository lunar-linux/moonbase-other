Portsentry is a program designed to detect and respond to port scans 
against a target host in real-time.
PortSentry has a number of options to detect port scans, when it finds one it
can react in the following ways:

   - A log indicating the incident is made via syslog()
   - The target host is automatically dropped into /etc/hosts.deny
     for TCP Wrappers
   - The local host is automatically re-configured to route all
     traffic to the target to a dead host to make the target system
     disappear.
   - The local host is automatically re-configured to drop all
     packets from the target via a local packet filter.


The purpose of this is to give an admin a heads up that their host is
being probed.
