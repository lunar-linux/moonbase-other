cat << EOF
Gorm allows developers to quickly create and edit graphical application
interfaces using a whole lot of GUI elements: windows, menus, buttons,
labels, sliders, tables, textfields, browsers, images, altert panels
and more. Custom palettes can be dynamically loaded to add additional
elements or functionality.

Note: you will need to have built gcc with the Objective-C option
to be able to build GNUstep modules. These modules have been built
according to http://gnustep.made-it.com/BuildGuide/ but are untested.
You will also need to customize the GNUstep environment before use.
