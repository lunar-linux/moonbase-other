cat << EOF
It is a library of graphical user interface classes written
completely in the Objective-C language; the classes are based upon the
OpenStep specification as release by NeXT Software, Inc.  The library
has been enhanced in a number of ways to take advantage of the GNU
system.  These classes include graphical objects such as buttons, text
fields, popup lists, browser lists, and windows; there are also many
associated classes for handling events, colors, fonts, pasteboards and
images.

Note: you will need to have built gcc with the Objective-C option
to be able to build GNUstep modules. These modules have been built
according to http://gnustep.made-it.com/BuildGuide/ but are untested.
You will also need to customize the GNUstep environment before use.
