ProjectCenter is meant to be the counter part to NeXT's Project
Builder. Thus, it helps you to start new projects and lets you
manage your project files using a intuitive and well ordered
graphical user interface.

Note: you will need to have built gcc with the Objective-C option
to be able to build GNUstep modules. These modules have been built
according to http://gnustep.made-it.com/BuildGuide/ but are untested.
You will also need to customize the GNUstep environment before use.
