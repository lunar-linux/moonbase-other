cat << EOF
Ion was written as an experiment on a different kind of window
management model. It tries to address the navigation problem
by dividing the screen into mutually non-overlapping frames that
take up the whole screen. Big displays have so much space that this
should be convenient and smaller displays couldn't show more than one
window at a time anyway. The frame layout is, of course, dynamic and
different on each workspace. Given the organised tree based instead
of an unorganised coordinate-based frame layout, moving between the
frames can be conveniently done from the keyboard. As in PWM, the
frames may have multiple clients attached, each indicated with a tab.

While this model makes using well-designed and well-behaving programs a
joy, some applications, obviously, don't work well in this model. These
are in particular those applications that do not conform to the ICCCM
(Inter-Client Communications Conventions Manual; the standard on how
WM:s and applications should communicate) and expect a particular
window management model. Badly-designed applications with multiple
top-level windows that affect a single document are also not
particularly well suited to the Ion model and should be fixed,
although can be occasionally kludged to be compatible.
