xmbase-grok is a program for displaying and editing strings arranged in a
grid of rows and columns. Each row is presented as a card consisting of
multiple columns, or fields, that allow data entry. The presentation of
the data is programmable; a user interface builder that allows the user
to arrange fields on a card graphically is part of xmbase-grok. xmbase-grok
also supports a simple language that allows sophisticated queries and data
retrieval. xmbase-grok comes with the above examples and a few others as
pre-built applications.
