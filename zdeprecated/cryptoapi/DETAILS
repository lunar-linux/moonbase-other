cat << EOF
This is a repackaged distribution based on the international crypto
patch for GNU/Linux, with the aim to improve adoption of this package
by not requiring to patch the kernel in order to be able to use the
cryptoapi and the loop encrytion.

This distribution is not meant as a project fork but as a branch,
which is intended to merge back improvements to the official
international crypto patch.
