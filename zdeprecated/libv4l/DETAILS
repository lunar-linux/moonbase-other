cat << EOF
libv4l is a collection of libraries that adds a thin abstraction layer on top of
video4linux2 (V4L2) devices. The purpose of this layer is to make it easy for
application writers to support a wide variety of devices without having to write
separate code for different devices in the same class. It consists of 3 different
libraries. libv4lconvert offers functions to convert from any (known) pixel
format to V4l2_PIX_FMT_BGR24 or V4l2_PIX_FMT_YUV420. libv4l1 offers the
(deprecated) v4l1 API on top of v4l2 devices, independent of the drivers for
those devices supporting v4l1 compatibility (which many v4l2 drivers do not).
libv4l2 offers the v4l2 API on top of v4l2 devices, while adding support for the
application transparent libv4lconvert conversion where necessary.
