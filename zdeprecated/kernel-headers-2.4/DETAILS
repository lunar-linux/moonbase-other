cat << EOF
The system kernel headers are taken from a (configured) kernel source and
may be re-installed after changes in kernel (which also ought to generally
be followed by a rebuild of glibc. This module is normally generated by
the glibc build. This module generates the '/usr/include' copies of the
kernel headers directly from the /usr/src/linux installed kernel sources.
