The Slides Document Type is an XML vocabulary derived from DocBook. It
is used to create presentations (slides, foils, whatever you call
them) in HTML or print.  Presentations are by nature visual and the
Slides stylesheets provide a wide range of options to control how the
transformation from XML to HTML is performed.
