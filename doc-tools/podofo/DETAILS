PoDoFo is a library to work with the PDF file format. The name comes from the 
first letter of PDF (Portable Document Format). A few tools to work with PDF 
files are already included in the PoDoFo package.

The PoDoFo library is a free, portable C++ library which includes classes to 
parse PDF files and modify their contents into memory. The changes can be 
written back to disk easily. The parser can also be used to extract 
information from a PDF file (for example the parser could be used in a PDF 
viewer). Besides parsing PoDoFo includes also very simple classes to create 
your own PDF files. All classes are documented so it is easy to start writing 
your own application using PoDoFo.
