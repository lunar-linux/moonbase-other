ITS Tool allows you to translate your XML documents with PO files.
ITS Tool is designed to make XML documents translatable through PO files by
applying standard ITS rules, as well as extension rules specific to ITS Tool.
ITS also provides an industry standard way for authors to override translation
information in their documents, such as whether a particular element should be
translated.
