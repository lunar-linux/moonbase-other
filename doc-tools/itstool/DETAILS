ITS Tool allows you to translate your XML documents with PO files. ITS Tool is designed to
make XML documents translatable through PO files by applying standard ITS rules, as well
as extension rules specific to ITS Tool. ITS also provides an industry standard way for
authors to override translation information in their documents, such as whether a
particular element should be translated.
