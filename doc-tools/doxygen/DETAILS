Doxygen is a documentation system for C++, Java, IDL (Corba, Microsoft and 
KDE-DCOP flavors) and C.

It can help you in three ways: 
 1. It can generate an on-line documentation browser (in HTML) and/or an 
    off-line reference manual (in ) from a set of documented source files. 
    There is also support for generating output in RTF (MS-Word), PostScript, 
    hyperlinked PDF, compressed HTML, and Unix man pages. The documentation is 
    extracted directly from the sources, which makes it much easier to keep the 
    documentation consistent with the source code.
 2. Doxygen can be configured to extract the code structure from undocumented 
    source files. This can be very useful to quickly find your way in large 
    source distributions. The relations between the various elements are be 
    visualized by means of include dependency graphs, inheritance diagrams, and 
    collaboration diagrams, which are all generated automatically.
 3. You can even abuse doxygen for creating normal documentation (as I did for 
    this manual). Doxygen is developed under Linux, but is set-up to be highly 
    portable. As a result, it runs on most other Unix flavors as well. 
    Furthermore, executables for Windows 9x/NT and Mac OS X are available.
