The renderer in MuPDF is tailored for high-quality anti-aliased
graphics. It renders text with metrics and spacing accurate to within
fractions of a pixel for the highest fidelity in reproducing the look
of a printed page on screen.

MuPDF has support for all non-interactive PDF 1.7 features, and the
toolkit provides a simple API for accessing the internal structures of
the PDF document.
