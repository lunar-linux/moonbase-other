The Tesseract OCR engine was one of the top 3 engines in the 1995 UNLV Accuracy
test. Between 1995 and 2006 it had little work done on it, but it is probably
one of the most accurate open source OCR engines available. The source code will
read a binary, grey or color image and output text. A tiff reader is built in that
will read uncompressed TIFF images, or libtiff can be added to read compressed
images.
