cat << EOF
DocBook is an XML/SGML vocabulary particularly well suited to books 
and papers about computer hardware and software (though it is by no
means limited to these applications).
The DocBook Technical Committee maintains the DocBook schema. 
DocBook is officially available as a Document Type Definition (DTD) 
for both XML and SGML. It is unofficially available in other forms 
as well.
