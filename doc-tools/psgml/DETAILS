cat << EOF
 Emacs is an advanced and extensible editor. A Major Mode customizes Emacs for editing text of a particular sort. PSGML is a major mode for SGML documents.

 PSGML has several functions for editing SGML documents. Indentation according to element nesting depth and identification of structural errors (but it is not a validating SGML parser). Menus and commands for inserting tags with only the contextually valid tags. Attribute values can be edited in a separate window with information about types and defaults. Structure based editing includes movement and killing; and also several commands for folding editing.
