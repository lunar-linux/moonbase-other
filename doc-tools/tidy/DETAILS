cat << EOF
When editing HTML it's easy to make mistakes. Wouldn't it be nice if 
there was a simple way to fix these mistakes automatically and tidy 
up sloppy editing into nicely layed out markup? Well now there is! 
Dave Raggett's HTML TIDY is a free utility for doing just that. It 
also works great on the atrociously hard to read markup generated by
specialized HTML editors and conversion tools, and can help you 
identify where you need to pay further attention on making your pages
more accessible to people with disabilities.
