wv (formerly known as MSWordView) is a library that understands the Microsoft
Word 2000, 97, 95 and 6 file formats and is able to convert Word documents into
HTML, which can then be read with a browser. It also allows other programs
access to word documents for the purpose of converting them to other formats
and is currently being used by Abiword as its word importer.
