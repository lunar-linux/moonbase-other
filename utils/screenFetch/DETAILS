cat <<EOF
ScreenFetch is a "Bash Screenshot Information Tool".
This handy Bash script can be used to generate one of those nifty terminal
theme information + ASCII distribution logos you see in everyone's screenshots
nowadays.
It will auto-detect your distribution and display an ASCII version of that
distribution's logo and some valuable information to the right.
There are options to specify no ASCII art, colors, taking a screenshot upon
displaying info, and even customizing the screenshot command!
This script is very easy to add to and can easily be extended.
