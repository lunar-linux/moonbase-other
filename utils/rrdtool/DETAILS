If you know MRTG, you can think of RRDtool as a reimplementation of MRTGs
graphing and logging features. Magnitudes faster and more flexible than
you ever thought possible

RRD is the Acronym for Round Robin Database. RRD is a system to store
and display time-series data (i.e. network bandwidth, machine-room
temperature, server load average). It stores the data in a very compact
way that will not expand over time, and it presents useful graphs by
processing the data to enforce a certain data density. It can be used either
via simple wrapper scripts (from shell or Perl) or via frontends that
poll network devices and put a friendly user interface on it.
