GNU parallel is a shell tool for executing jobs in parallel locally or
using remote computers. A job is typically a single command or a small
script that has to be run for each of the lines in the input. The
typical input is a list of files, a list of hosts, a list of users,
a list of URLs, or a list of tables.

If you use xargs today you will find GNU parallel very easy to use as
GNU parallel is written to have the same options as xargs. If you write
loops in shell, you will find GNU parallel may be able to replace most
of the loops and make them run faster by running several jobs in
parallel. If you use ppss or pexec you will find GNU parallel will
often make the command easier to read.

GNU parallel makes sure output from the commands is the same output as
you would get had you run the commands sequentially. This makes it
possible to use output from GNU parallel as input for other programs.

For each line of input GNU parallel will execute command with the line
as arguments. If no command is given, the line of input is executed.
Several lines will be run in parallel. GNU parallel can often be used
as a substitute for xargs or cat | sh.
