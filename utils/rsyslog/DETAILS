           SHORT="An enhanced multi-threaded syslogd"

cat << EOF
Rsyslog is an enhanced multi-threaded syslogd with a focus on security and
reliability. Among others, it offers support for on-demand disk buffering,
reliable syslog over TCP, SSL, TLS and RELP, writing to databases (MySQL,
PostgreSQL, Oracle, and many more), email alerting, fully configurable output
formats (including high-precision timestamps), the ability to filter on any
part of the syslog message, on-the-wire message compression, and the ability
to convert text files to syslog. It is a drop-in replacement for stock syslogd
and able to work with the same configuration file syntax.
