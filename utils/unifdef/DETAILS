Unifdef is useful for removing #ifdef'ed lines from a file while
otherwise leaving the file alone. You specify which symbols are
defined or undefined with -D and -U flags, and unifdef removes
the corresponding ifdefs, and the enclosed code if appropriate.

It's especially useful for removing those "#ifdef BROKEN" and
"#ifdef PRIVATE" clauses from code before you release it. Unifdef
acts on #ifdef, #ifndef, #else, and #en­ dif lines, and it knows
only enough about C and C++ to know when one of these is inactive
because it is inside a comment, or a single or double quote.
