cat << EOF
GNU gperf is a perfect hash function generator. For a given list of strings,
it produces a hash function and hash table, in form of C or C++ code, for
looking up a value depending on the input string. The hash function is
perfect, which means that the hash table has no collisions, and the hash
table lookup needs a single string comparison only.

GNU gperf is highly customizable. There are options for generating C or C++
code, for emitting switch statements or nested ifs instead of a hash table,
and for tuning the algorithm employed by gperf.
