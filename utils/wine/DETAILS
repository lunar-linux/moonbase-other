Wine Is Not an Emulator. It is an alternative implementation of the
Windows 3.x and Win32 APIs. Wine provides both a development toolkit
(Winelib) for porting legacy Windows sources to Unix and a program
loader, allowing unmodified Windows 3.1/95/NT binaries to run under
Intel Unixes. Wine does not require Microsoft Windows, as it is a
completely alternative implementation consisting of 100%
Microsoft-Free code, but it can optionally use native system DLLs if
they are available.
