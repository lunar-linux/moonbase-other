           SHORT="A TCP/IP connection cutter for IPtables based firewalls"

cat << EOF
Cutter allows network administrators to close TCP/IP connections 
running over a Linux/IPtables firewall.  It closes the connection in
such a way as to lead BOTH ends (client and server) to believe that
it was aborted by the other.
