AMANDA, the Advanced Maryland Automatic Network Disk Archiver, is
a backup system that allows the administrator of a LAN to set up a
single master backup server to back up multiple hosts to a single
large capacity tape drive. AMANDA uses native dump and/or GNU tar
facilities and can back up a large number of workstations running
multiple versions of Unix. Recent versions can also use SAMBA to back
up Microsoft Windows hosts.
