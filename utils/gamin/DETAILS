cat << EOF
Gamin is a file and directory monitoring system defined to be a subset
of the FAM (File Alteration Monitor) system.  This is a service provided
by a library which allows to detect when a file or a directory has been
modified.

It is strongly suggested you use Gamin with an inotify enabled kernel for
best performance!
