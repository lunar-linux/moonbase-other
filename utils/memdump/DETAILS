           SHORT="The memory dump utility from The Coroner's Toolkit (TCT)"

cat << EOF
This is a memory dummper for UNIX-like systems.  It is part of The
Coroner's Toolkit (TCT), which is a collection of programs by Dan
Farmer & Wietse Venema for a post-mortem analysis of a UNIX system
after break-in.

To dump physical memory:
    memdump | nc host port
    memdump | openssl s_client -connect host:port

For best results send output off-host over the network. Writing to
file risks clobbering all the memory in the file system cache. Use
netcat, stunnel, or openssl, depending on your requirements.
