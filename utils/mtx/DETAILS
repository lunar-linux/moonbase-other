cat << EOF
mtx is a set of low level driver programs to control features of SCSI backup
related devices such as autoloaders, tape changers, media jukeboxes, and
tape drives. It can also report much data, including serial numbers, maximum
block sizes, and TapeAlert(tm) messages that most modern tape drives
implement (to tell you the exact reason why a backup or restore failed), as
well as do raw SCSI READ and WRITE commands to tape drives (not important on
Linux, but important on Solaris due to the fact that the Solaris tape driver
supports none of the additional features of tape drives invented after
1988). mtx is designed to be a low level driver in a larger scripted backup
solution, such as Amanda. mtx is not supposed to itself be a high level
interface to the SCSI devices that it controls.
