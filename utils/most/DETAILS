most is a paging program that displays, one windowful at a time, the 
contents of a file on a terminal. It pauses after each windowful and
prints on the window status line the screen the file name, current line
number, and the percentage of the file so far displayed. Unlike other
paging programs, most is capable of displaying an arbitrary number of
windows as long as each window occupies at least two screen lines.
