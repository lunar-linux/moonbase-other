The OpenLDAP Project is a collaborative effort to provide a robust,
commercial-grade, fully featured, open source LDAP software suite. The
project is managed by a worldwide community of volunteers that use
the Internet to communicate, plan, and develop OpenLDAP Software and
its related documentation. OpenLDAP Software provides a complete LDAP
implementation including server, clients, C SDK, and associated tools.
