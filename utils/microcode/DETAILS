cat <<EOF
The microcode data file contains the latest
microcode definitions for all Intel processors.
Intel releases microcode updates to correct
processor behavior as documented
in the respective processor specification updates.
While the regular approach to getting
this microcode update is via a BIOS upgrade,
Intel realizes that this can be an administrative hassle.
The Linux Operating System and VMware ESX products
have a mechanism to update the microcode after booting.
For example, this file will be used by
the operating system mechanism if the file is placed
in the /etc/firmware directory of the Linux system.
