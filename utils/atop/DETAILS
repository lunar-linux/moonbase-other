The command atop is an ASCII full-screen performance-monitor on
system-level and process-level. It looks similar to the other
full-screen monitors, however there are some major differences.

Advantages of atop:

It shows the resource-consumption of all processes which were active
during the interval, so including those processes which finished during
the interval

It shows system-level counters concerning cpu-, memory- and
swap-utilization, but also disk I/O and network utilization counters
are shown on system-level

By default, it only shows system-resources and processes which were
really active during the last interval

For the active system resources and processes, only the load of the
last interval is shown (not the accumulated utilization since boot)

It is able to store raw counter-data in a file (compressed) for
long-term analysis on system- and process-level. By default the logfiles
are preserved for 28 days.  In combination with optional
kernel patches: It shows process-level counters concerning disk I/O
and network activity.
