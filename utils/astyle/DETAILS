Artistic Style is a source code indenter, formatter, and beautifier
for the C, C++, C# and Java programming languages.

To address the problem of hard and soft tabs in editors and source
code, Artistic Style was created - a filter written in C++ that
automatically re-indents and re-formats C / C++ / C# / Java source
files. It can be used from a command line, or it can be incorporated
as classes in another C++ program.
