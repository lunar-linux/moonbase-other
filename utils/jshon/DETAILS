cat <<EOF
Jshon parses, reads and creates JSON. It is designed to be as usable
as possible from within the shell and replaces fragile adhoc parsers
made from grep/sed/awk as well as heavyweight one-line parsers made
from perl/python.

Jshon loads json text from stdin, performs actions, then displays
the last action on stdout. Some of the options output json, others
output plain text meta information. Because Bash has very poor
nested datastructures, Jshon does not try to return a native bash
datastructure as a tpical library would. Instead, Jshon provides a
history stack containing all the manipulations.
