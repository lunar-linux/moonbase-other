cat << EOF
The libsmbios project aims towards providing access
to as much BIOS information as possible.
SMBIOS is a standards-based approach for hardware vendors
to present and structure management data for consumption
by OS and Management Applications.
Basically, the system BIOS leaves a small table in memory
that can be found by the OS after system boot.
This table has a standardized format that can easily
be parsed by application software.
Several Dell-specific hardware features, such as
BIOS update, CMOS Tokens, SMI, hardware probes
(temperature, fan, etc) are represented
in the SMBIOS tables. Because of this, libsmbios
has code to enable these features on Dell systems.
