cat << EOF
Free42 is a complete re-implementation of the HP-42S calculator and the
HP-82240 printer. Free42 was written from scratch, without using any HP code.
You do not need any ROM images in order to use it, yet it is fully HP-42S
compatible.
This is also a cross-platform implementation. The author provides binaries for
PocketPC, PalmOS, Windows, Mac OS/X, and Linux.
