GNU Parted allows you to create, destroy, resize, and copy partitions.
Supported partition types include ext2 and FAT (FAT 16 and FAT32)
file systems and Linux swap devices.  Supported disk labels include
MD-DOS and PC98 partition tables.  Sun and BSD disk labels,
Macintosh partition maps, and raw access.  Parted is useful for
creating space and for new operating systems, reorganizing disk usage,
copying data between hard disks, and disk imaging.
