Announcing version 1.1.3 of Xdelta.  Xdelta is an application program
designed to compute changes between files.  These changes (deltas) are
similar to the output of the "diff" program in that they may be used
to store and transmit only the changes between files.  However, unlike
diff, the output of Xdelta is not expressed in a human-readable
format--Xdelta can also also apply these deltas to a copy of the
original file.  Xdelta uses a fast, linear algorithm and performs well
on both binary and text files.
