cat << EOF
Multiple-email in file extraction, meaning you can now extract all the
attachments from a spool file (ie, /var/spool/mail/joebloe). Nested-email
attachment extraction, allowing ripMIME to get out those attachments which
people have "forwarded". More copious testings (we've tested it on about
1000+ realworld emails). Still less than 20K in size (stripped x86 binary)
