# Multiple-email in file extraction, meaning you can now extract all the attachments from a spool file (ie, /var/spool/mail/joebloe).
# Nested-email attachment extraction, allowing ripMIME to get out those attachments which people have "forwarded"
# More copious testings (we've tested it on about 1000+ realworld emails)
# Still less than 20K in size (stripped x86 binary)
