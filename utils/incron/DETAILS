cat << EOF
This program is an "inotify cron" system. It works like the regular
cron but is driven by filesystem events instead of time periods. It
contains two programs, a daemon called "incrond" (analogous to crond)
and a table manipulator "incrontab" (like "crontab").
You can use it a similar way as the regular cron. The difference is
that the inotify cron handles filesystem events rather than time
periods.

Here you can see a few examples where incron is a good solution:
  -notifying programs (e.g. server daemons) about changes in
   configuration
  -guarding changes in critical files (with their eventual recovery)
  -file usage monitoring, statistics
  -automatic on-crash cleanup
  -automatic on-change backup or versioning
  -new mail notification (for maildir)
  -server upload notification
  -installation management (outside packaging systems)
  -...and many others
