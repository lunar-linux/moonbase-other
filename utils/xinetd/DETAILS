cat << EOF
xinetd is a replacement for inetd, the internet services daemon. Anybody can use
it to start servers that don't require privileged ports because xinetd does not
require that the services in its configuration file be listed in /etc/services.
It can do access control on all services based on the address of the remote host
and time of access. Access control works on all services, whether multi-threaded
or single-threaded and for both the TCP and UDP protocols. xinetd supports both
internal access control, and the use of the libwrap library.
IPv6 with access control is also supported.
