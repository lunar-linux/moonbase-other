Doodle is a tool to quickly search the documents on a computer.  Doodle
builds an index using meta-data contained in the documents and allows 
fast searches on the resulting database.  Doodle uses libextractor to
support obtaining meta-data from various file-formats.  The database
used by doodle is a suffix tree, resulting in fast lookups.  Doodle
supports approximate searches. 

Indexing large volumes can take several hundred MBs of memory (depending
on the amount of meta-data found).  Searching should nevertheless 
require almost no memory.
