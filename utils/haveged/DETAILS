cat << EOF
Linux provides device interfaces (/dev/random and /dev/urandom) to a pool of
random numbers collected from system interrupt service routines.
On some systems, especially on those systems with high needs or limited user
interaction, the standard collection mechanism cannot meet demand.
In those cases, an adequate supply of random numbers can be maintained by
feeding additional entropy into /dev/random pool via a file system interface.
The haveged daemon was created to fulfill this function using random data
generated by the HAVEGE algorithm.
