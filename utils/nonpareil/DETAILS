cat << EOF
Nonpareil is a high-fidelity simulator for calculators. It currently supports
many HP calculators models introduced between 1972 and 1982. Simulation
fidelity is achieved through the use of the actual microcode of the
calculators, thus in most cases the simulation behavior exactly matches that of
the real calculator. In particular, numerical results will be identical,
because the simulator is using the BCD arithmetic algorithms from the
calculator. Models currently emulated include: HP-11c, 12c, 15c, 16c, 21, 25,
25c, 32e, 33c, 34c, 35, 37e, 38c, 38e, 41c, 41cv, 41cx, 45, 55, 80.
