GNU Stow is a program for managing the installation of software
packages, keeping them separate (/usr/local/stow/emacs vs.
/usr/local/stow/perl, for example) while making them appear to
be installed in the same place (/usr/local). Stow was inspired
by Carnegie Mellon's Depot program, but is substantially simpler.
