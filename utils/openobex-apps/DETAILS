cat << EOF
The overall goal of this project is to make an open source 
implementation of the Object Exchange (OBEX) protocol. OBEX is a session 
protocol and can best be described as a binary HTTP protocol. OBEX is 
optimised for ad-hoc wireless links and can be used to exchange all kind 
of objects like files, pictures, calendar entries (vCal) and business 
cards (vCard).
