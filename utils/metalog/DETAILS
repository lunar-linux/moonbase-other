cat << EOF
Metalog is a modern replacement for syslogd and klogd. The logged messages
can be dispatched according to their facility, urgency, program name and/or
Perl-compatible regular expressions. Log files can be automatically rotated
when they exceed a certain size or age. External shell scripts (e.g., mail)
can be launched when specific patterns are found.
Metalog is simple to configure, accepts unlimited number of rules and has
(switchable) memory bufferization for maximal performance.
