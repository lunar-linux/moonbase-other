grep - Finds lines that match entered patterns
Package includes the GNU 'grep,' 'egrep,' and 'fgrep,' which find lines
that match entered patterns. By default, grep prints the matching lines.
GNU grep is based on a fast lazy-state deterministic matcher (about
twice as fast as the standard Unix grep) hybridized with a
Boyer-Moore-Gosper search for a fixed string that eliminates impossible
text from being considered by the full regexp match without having to
look at every chanracter; the result is usually many times faster that
UNIX 'grep' or 'egrep.'
