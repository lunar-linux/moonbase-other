cat << EOF
This project (double-conversion) provides binary-decimal and decimal-binary
routines for IEEE doubles.
The library consists of efficient conversion routines that have been extracted
from the V8 JavaScript engine. The code has been refactored and improved so that
it can be used more easily in other projects.
