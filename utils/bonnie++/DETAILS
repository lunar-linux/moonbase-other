Bonnie++ is based on the Bonnie hard drive benchmark by Tim Bray. The 
most notable features that have been added are support for >2G of
storage and testing operations involving thousands of files in a
directory. This program is used by ReiserFS developers, but can be
useful for anyone who wants to know how fast her hard drive or file
system is. It now includes ZCAV in the package. This program tests
the performance of different zones on the hard drive. ZCAV has been a 
released seperately before but will now only be released as part of
the Bonnie++ suite.
