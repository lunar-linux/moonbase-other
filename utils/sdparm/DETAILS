The sdparm utility outputs and in some cases modifies SCSI device
parameters. When the SCSI device is a disk, sdparm's role is similar
to its  namesake: the linux hdparm utility which is for ATA disks that
usually have device names starting with "hd". More generally sdparm
can be used to output and modify parameters on any device that uses a
SCSI command set. Apart from SCSI disks, such devices include CD/DVD
drives (irrespective of transport), SCSI and ATAPI tape drives and
SCSI enclosures. A small set of commands associated with starting
and stopping the media, loading and unloading removable media and
some other housekeeping functions can also be sent by this utility.
