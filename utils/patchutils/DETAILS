Patchutils contains a collection of tools for manipulating patch files:
  interdiff   : show differences between two diff files
  combinediff : create a cumulative unified patch from two incremental patches
  filterdiff  : extract or exclude diffs from a diff file
  fixcvsdiff  : fix problematic diff files
  lsdiff      : show which files are modified by a patch
  splitdiff   : separate out incremental patches
  rediff      : fix offsets and counts of a hand-edited diff
  grepdiff    : show files modified by a diff containing a regex
  recountdiff : recompute patch counts and offsets
  unwrapdiff  : demangle word-wrapped patches
  dehtmldiff  : get usable diff from an HTML page
  flipdiff    : exchange the order of two incremental patches
  espdiff     : apply the appropriate transformation to a set of patches.
