XMLTV is a set of utilities to manage your TV viewing. They work with 
TV listings stored in the XMLTV format, which is based on XML. The idea 
is to separate out the backend (getting the listings) from the frontend 
(displaying them for the user), and to implement useful operations like 
picking out your favourite programmes as filters that read and write XML 
documents.
