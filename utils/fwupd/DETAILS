cat << EOF
This project aims to make updating firmware on Linux automatic, safe and
reliable.
This project is configured by default to download firmware from the Linux Vendor
Firmware Service (LVFS).
This service is available to all OEMs and firmware creators who would like to
make their firmware available to Linux users.
You can find more information about the technical details of creating a firmware
capsule in the 
hardware vendors section of the fwupd website.
