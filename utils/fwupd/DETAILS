This project aims to make updating firmware on Linux automatic, safe and reliable.

This project is configured by default to download firmware from the Linux Vendor Firmware Service (LVFS).

This service is available to all OEMs and firmware creators who would like to make their firmware available to Linux users.

You can find more information about the technical details of creating a firmware capsule in the 
hardware vendors section of the fwupd website.
