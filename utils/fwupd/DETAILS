This project aims to make updating firmware on Linux automatic, safe and
reliable. This project is configured by default to download firmware from
the Linux Vendor Firmware Service (LVFS). This service is available to all
OEMs and firmware creators who would like to make their firmware available
to Linux users. You can find more information about the technical details
of creating a firmware capsule in the hardware vendors section of the fwupd
website.
