SYSLINUX is a boot loader for the Linux operating system which operates
off of MS-DOS floppies. It is intended to simplify first-time
installation of Linux, rescue disks, and other uses for boot floppies. A
SYSLINUX floppy can be manipulated using standard MS-DOS (or any other
OS that can access an MS-DOS filesystem) tools once it has been created,
and requires only a ~ 8K DOS program or ~ 16K Linux program to create it
in the first place. It also includes PXELINUX, a program to boot off a
network server using a boot PROM compatible with the Intel PXE
(Pre-Execution Environment) specification, and ISOLINUX, a program to
boot off ISO 9660 CD-ROMs in native mode.
