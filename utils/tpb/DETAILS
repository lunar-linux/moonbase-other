TPB is a little program that enables you to use the IBM ThinkPad(tm)
special keys.  With TPB it is possible to bind a program to the
ThinkPad, Mail, Home and Search button. TPB can also run a callback
program on each state change with the changed state and the new
state as options. So it is possible to trigger several actions on
different events. TPB has a on-screen display (OSD) to show volume,
mute, brightness and some other informations. Furthermore TPB supports
a software mixer, as the R series ThinkPads have no hardware mixer
to change the volume.
