USB_ModeSwitch is (surprise!) a mode switching tool for controlling "flip flop" (multiple device) USB gear.

More and more USB devices (especially high-speed WAN stuff, based on cell phone chipsets containing that 
feature) have their MS Windows drivers onboard; when plugged in for the first time they act like a flash 
storage and start installing the driver from there. After installation (and on every consecutive plugging) 
the driver switches the mode internally, the storage device vanishes (in most cases), and a new device (like 
an USB modem) shows up. Modem maker "Option" calls that feature "ZeroCD (TM)" since it eliminates the need 
for shipping a separate driver carrier.

USB_ModeSwitch makes this process easy to handle by taking the important parameters from a configuration file 
and doing all the initialization and communication stuff, with heavy help from "libusb".
It is mainly used automatically - via udev events and rules - to do the switch without any user interaction. 
But it can also be run as a command line tool, usually when trying to make unknown devices work with it.
