cat << EOF
Using device-mapper's dmsetup directly is too complicated for most people.
Cryptsetup is being written to behave like one of the patched losetup's
out there.

LUKS for dm-crypt is implemented in cryptsetup. cryptsetup-luks is intended
as a complete replacement for the original cryptsetup. It provides all the
functionally of the original version plus all LUKS features, that are accessable by luks* action.
