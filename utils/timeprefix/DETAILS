timeprefix ignores all arguments. It reads stdin line by line and prefix the
current time (at the point the line has been fully read) to each line and prints
the prefixed line to stdout.
The timestamp is written in both decimal boot time and human-readable real time
(in UTC), with with boot time first so that muliple generated log files can
merged into one with sort --merge.
timeprefix also marks when the program started and terminated.
