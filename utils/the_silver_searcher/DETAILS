cat <<EOF
A code searching tool similar to ack, with a focus on speed.

Ag features:
- It is an order of magnitude faster than ack.
- It ignores file patterns from your .gitignore and .hgignore.
- If there are files in your source repo you don't want to search, just add
  their patterns to a .ignore file. (*cough* *.min.js *cough*).
- The command name is 33% shorter than ack, and all keys are on the home row.

This fork's features:
- Requires libpcre2, pcre version 1 is no longer supported
- Support for a .agrc file which may contain arbitrary options, one per line.
  Default is ~/.agrc, and can be set with --agrc=<file> on the command line.
- Various memory leaks fixed, plus a script for testing with LLVM Sanitizers.
- Various cosmetic and usability tweaks.
