cat << EOF
GNU GRUB is a Multiboot boot loader. It was derived from GRUB, GRand
Unified Bootloader, which was originally designed and implemented by
Erich Stefan Boleyn. Briefly, bootloader is the first software program
that runs when a computer starts. It is responsible for loading and
transferring control to the operating system kernel software (such as
the Hurd or the Linux). The kernel, in turn, initializes the rest of
the operating system (e.g. GNU).  Now with JFS and XFS support!

Sample commands to install grub on an ide hard drive with a boot
partition at /dev/hda1, swap at /dev/hda2, and root at /dev/hda3 are:

~# grub
grub> root (hd0,0)
grub> setup (hd0)
grub> quit

Sample /boot/grub/menu.lst file is:

default 0
timeout 30
title=Lunar kernel 2.4.25
root (hd0,0)
kernel /vmlinubz-2.4.25 root=/dev/hda3 devfs=nomount
