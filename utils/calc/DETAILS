Calc is an interactive calculator which provides for easy large numeric
calculations, but which also can be easily programmed for difficult
or long calculations.  It can accept a command line argument, in which
case it executes that single command and exits.  Otherwise, it enters
interactive mode.  In this mode, it accepts commands one at a time,
processes them, and displays the answers. Cals comes with a rich set of
builtin mathematical and programmatic functions. Try "help builtin" or
"help overview" at the calc command prompt.  It's useful as a calculator,
an algorithm prototyper, and as a mathematical research tool.  More
importantly, calc provides a machine-independent means of computation.
Much more full-featured than BC.
