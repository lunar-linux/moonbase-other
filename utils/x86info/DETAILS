cat << EOF
Unlike other cpuinfo tools which just parse /proc/cpuinfo, x86info
probes the CPU registers to find out a lot more information. It can
discover the contents of model-specific registers, discover CPU silicon
revisions, and lots more.

For complete information make sure you have cpu/*/msr and cpu/*/cpuid
compiled into or as loaded modules for your running kernel.
