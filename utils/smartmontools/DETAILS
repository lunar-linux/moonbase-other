The smartmontools package contains two utility programs (smartctl and smartd)
to control and monitor storage systems using the Self-Monitoring, Analysis
and Reporting Technology System (SMART) built into most modern ATA and SCSI
hard disks. In many cases, these utilities will provide advanced warning
of disk degradation and failure.
