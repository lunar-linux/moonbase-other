cat << EOF
The microcode_ctl utility is a companion to the IA32 microcode driver
written by Tigran Aivazian <tigran@aivazian.fsnet.co.uk>. The utility
has two uses:

    * it decodes and sends new microcode to the kernel driver to
    be uploaded to Intel IA32 processors. (Pentium Pro, PII, PIII,
    Pentium 4, Celeron, Xeon etc - all P6 and above, which does NOT
    include pentium classics). It also supports processors of the
    x86_64 architecture.  * it signals the kernel driver to release
    any buffers it may hold

The microcode update is volatile and needs to be uploaded on each
system boot i.e. it doesn't reflash your cpu permanently, reboot and
it reverts back to the old microcode.
