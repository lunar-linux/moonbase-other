Xdelta3 is the third and latest release of Xdelta,
which is a set of tools and APIs for reading and writing
compressed deltas. Deltas encode the differences between
two versions of a document. This release features a completely
new compression engine, several algorithmic improvements,
a fully programmable interface modelled after zlib,
in addition to a command-line utility,
use of the RFC3284 (VCDIFF) encoding, a python extension,
and now 64-bit support.
