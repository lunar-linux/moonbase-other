Cpufreqd is a userspace cpu speed and voltage adjuster for the cpufreq
kernel drivers it changes the speed depending on if you are on ac
power or battery and if you are using your cup at all afaik only for
2.6 unless you have the cpufreqd patches for 2.4 it has a simple config
file in /etc/cpufreqd.conf where you can set your options also has some
cool features such as if mplayer is running or xine throttle the cpu
a certain way etc... great for laptops.
