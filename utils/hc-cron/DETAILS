hc-cron is a cron daemon for 'home computers'. It runs specified jobs
at periodic intervals and will remember the time when it was shut
down and catch up jobs that have occurred during down time when it is
started again. Hc-cron is based on the widely used vixie-cron and
uses the same crontab format so that it can be used as a drop-in
replacement for that program.
