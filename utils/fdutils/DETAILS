cat << EOF
The fdutils package contains utilities for configuring and debugging
the Linux floppy driver, for formatting extra capacity disks (up to
1992K on a high density disk), and for sending raw commands to th
e floppy controller.

It includes the following items:
  * superformat: formats high capacity disks of (up to 1992k for high
                 density disks or up to 3984k for extra density disks)
  * fdmount: automatically mounts/unmounts disks when they are
             inserted/removed
  * xdfcopy: formats, reads and writes OS/2's XDF disks
  * MAKEFLOPPIES: creates the floppy devices in /dev
  * getfdprm: prints the current disk geometry (number of sectors,
              track and heads etc)
  * setfdprm: sets the current disk geometry
  * fdrawcmd: sends raw commands to the floppy driver
  * floppycontrol: configure the floppy driver
  * General documentation about the floppy driver
