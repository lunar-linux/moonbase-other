cat << EOF
ACPID is a completely flexible, totally extensible daemon for delivering 
ACPI events. It listens on a file (/proc/acpi/event) and when an event 
occurs, executes programs to handle the event. The programs it executes 
are configured through a set of configuration files, which can be dropped 
into place by packages or by the admin.
