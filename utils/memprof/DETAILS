cat << EOF
MemProf is a tool for profiling memory usage and finding memory leaks.
Its two major features are:
 * It can generate a profile how much memory was allocated by each
   function in your program.
 * It can scan memory and find blocks that you've allocated but are no
   longer referenced anywhere.
