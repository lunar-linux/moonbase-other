MultiTail lets you view one or multiple files like the original tail program.
The difference is that it creates multiple windows on your console (with
ncurses). It can also monitor wildcards: if another file matching the wildcard
has a more recent modification date, it will automatically switch to that file.
That way you can, for example, monitor a complete directory of files. Merging
of 2 or even more logfiles is possible. It can also use colors while displaying
the logfiles (through regular expressions), for faster recognition of what is
important and what not. It can also filter lines (again with regular
expressions). It has interactive menus for editing given regular expressions
and deleting and adding windows. One can also have windows with the output of
shell scripts and other software. When viewing the output of external software,
MultiTail can mimic the functionality of tools like 'watch' and such.
