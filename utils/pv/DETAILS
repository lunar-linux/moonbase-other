pv - Pipe Viewer - is a terminal-based tool for monitoring the progress of
data through a pipeline. It can be inserted into any normal pipeline between
two processes to give a visual indication of how quickly data is passing
through, how long it has taken, how near to completion it is, and an estimate
of how long it will be until completion.
