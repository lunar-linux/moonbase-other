cat << EOF
AcpiTool is (yet another) Linux ACPI client. It's a small command-line
application, intended to be a replacement for the apm tool. The
primary target audience are laptop users, since these people are most
interested in stuff like battery status, thermal status and the ability
to put their precious laptop to sleep. Most of this does not apply to
desktop systems.

The program simply accesses the /proc/acpi or /sysfs entries to get/set
acpi values. Hence, you need a computer running a Linux kernel from
the 2.4.x or 2.6.x series with acpi enabled, to use this program.

AcpiTool is currently developped on a Toshiba Satellite Pro 6000,
running Slackware 10.0 with kernel 2.6.8.1, patched with latest ACPI
patches (version 20040715). This application started as an attempt to
"refurbish" my C++ programming skills, which were dormant for several
years.
