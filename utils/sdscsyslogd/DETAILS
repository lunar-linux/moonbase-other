The SDSC Secure Syslog (also known as High Performance Syslog) is a
project to build a next-generation system audit and logging facility.
The goal is to build a system logging facility that addresses these problems:

High volume of system logs at medium and large sites (such as e-commerce sites or ISPs)
can easily overwhelm "classic" syslog and its UDP transport mechanism;

This encourages sites to either not create some logs or to frequently
roll them over and discard old log messages;

Which makes it difficult to conduct investigations of computer-related
crime and related incidents.
