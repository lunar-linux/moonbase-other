cat << EOF
Elektra is a universal hierarchical configuration store, with related goals 
like GConf and the Windows Registry. It allows programs to read and save 
their configurations with a consistent API, and allows them to be aware of 
other applications' configurations, leveraging easy application integration. 
The whole point of it is to tie applications together, so that they can 
co-operate and share their user-preferences.
