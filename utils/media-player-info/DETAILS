media-player-info is a repository of data files describing media player 
capabilities, mostly of mass-storage devices. These files contain information
about the directory layout to use to add music to these devices, the supported
file formats and so on.

These capabilities used to be provided by HAL in the 10-usb-music-players.fdi 
file, but HAL is now deprecated, so the information is being provided as a 
separate package.
