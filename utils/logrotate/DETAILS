cat << EOF
The logrotate utility is designed to simplify the administration of log files on
a system which generates a lot of log files. Logrotate allows for the automatic
rotation compression, removal, and mailing of log files. Logrotate can be set to
handle a log file daily, weekly, monthly, or when the log file gets to a certain
size. Normally, logrotate runs as a daily cron job.
