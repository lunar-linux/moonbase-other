FIGlet prints its input using  large  characters  (called  ``FIGcharac-
ters'')made  up  of  ordinary  screen  characters (called ``sub-charac-
ters'').  FIGlet output is generally reminiscent of the sort of  ``sig-
natures''  many people like to put at the end of e-mail and UseNet mes-
sages.  It is also reminiscent of the output of some  banner  programs,
although it is oriented normally, not sideways.
