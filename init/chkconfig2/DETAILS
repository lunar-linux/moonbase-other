chkconfig: Chkconfig is a basic system utility.  It updates and 
queries runlevel information for system services.  Chkconfig 
manipulates the numerous symbolic links in /etc/rc.d, to relieve 
system administrators of some of the drudgery of manually editing 
the symbolic links.

ntsysv: Ntsysv provides a simple interface for setting which system 
services are started or stopped in various runlevels (instead of 
directly manipulating the numerous symbolic links in /etc/rc.d). 
Unless you specify a runlevel or runlevels on the command line (see 
the man page), ntsysv configures the current runlevel (5 if you're 
using X).

alternatives: alternatives creates, removes, maintains and displays 
information about the symbolic links comprising the alternatives 
system. The alternatives system is a reimplementation of the Debian 
alternatives system. It was rewritten primarily to remove the 
dependence on perl; it is intended to be a drop in replacement for 
Debian's update-dependencies script. See the man page (alternatives(8))
for more information.
