Chkconfig is a tool for managing the collection of symbolic links
found in the /etc/rc.d directory, on System V derived UNIX systems. It
saves the system administrator from the tedium of manually managing
the scores of symbolic links.

SGI originally created chkconfig and shipped it with their IRIX
operating system. In 1993, Italo Lisi and Luigi Genoni created a script
version of chkconfig for Linux. Several years later, RedHat
independently created their own C version of the same idea, which is
the basis for the code provided here.
