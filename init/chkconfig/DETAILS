chkconfig
Chkconfig is a tool for managing the collection of symbolic links found in the /etc/rc.d directory, on System V derived UNIX systems. It saves the system administrator from the tedium of manually managing the scores of symbolic links.

SGI originally created chkconfig and shipped it with their IRIX operating system. In 1993, Italo Lisi and Luigi Genoni created a script version of chkconfig for Linux. Several years later, RedHat independently created their own C version of the same idea, which is the basis for the code provided here.
