sash - Stand Alone SHell
The purpose of this program is to make system recovery possible in
many cases where there are missing shared libraries or executables.
It does this by firstly being linked statically, and secondly by
including versions of many of the standard utilities within itself.
Patched to include some GNU Readline features:
1. The TAB key for command and filename completion.
2. The keys Ctrl-N and Ctrl-P for a command history.
Further patched to include the chroot, pivot_root, and losetup functions.
Simple shell variable expansion support has also been added.
