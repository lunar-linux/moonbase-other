cat << EOF
BusyBox combines tiny versions of many common UNIX utilities into a single small
executable. It provides minimalist replacements for most of the utilities you
usually find in GNU fileutils, shellutils, etc.
The utilities in BusyBox generally have fewer options than their full-featured
GNU cousins; however, the options that are included provide the expected
functionality and behave very much like their GNU counterparts. BusyBox provides
a fairly complete POSIX environment for any small or embedded system.
