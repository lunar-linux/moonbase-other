A friendly shell that has several features:

Autosuggestions - fish suggests commands as you type based on history and
    completions, just like a web browser.
Color - fish supports 24 bit true color, the state of the art in terminal
    technology.
Scripting - fish is fully scriptable, and its syntax is simple, clean, and
    consistent.
