Zsh is a UNIX command interpreter (shell) which of the standard
shells most resembles the Korn shell (ksh). It includes enhancements
of many types, notably in the command-line editor, options for
customising its behaviour, filename globbing, features to make
C-shell (csh) users feel more at home and extra features drawn from
tcsh.
