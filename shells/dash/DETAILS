cat <<EOF
The Debian Almquist Shell (dash) is a lightweight POSIX-compliant
shell derived from ash.
It can be usefully installed as /bin/sh (because it executes scripts
faster than bash), or as the default shell for the superuser. It
depends on fewer libraries than bash, and is therefore less likely
to be affected by an upgrade problem or a disk failure. It is also
useful for checking the POSIX compliance of scripts.
