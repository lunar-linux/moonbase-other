cat << EOF
The DejaVu fonts are a font family based on the Bitstream Vera Fonts release
1.10. Its purpose is to provide a wider range of characters (see Current
status page for more information) while maintaining the original look and
feel through the process of collaborative development (see Authors).
The family is available as TrueType fonts and also as third-party packages.
