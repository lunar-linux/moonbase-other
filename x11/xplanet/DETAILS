cat << EOF
Xplanet was inspired by Xearth, which renders an image of the earth into 
the X root window. Azimuthal, Mercator, Mollweide, orthographic, or 
rectangular projections can be shown as well as a window with a globe the 
user can rotate interactively using OpenGL or Mesa. The other planets and 
some satellites may also be displayed.
