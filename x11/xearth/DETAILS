Xearth sets the X root window to an image of the Earth, as seen from
your favorite vantage point in space, correctly shaded for the current
position of the Sun. By default, xearth updates the displayed image
every five minutes.

The time between updates can be changed using either X resource or a
command-line option. Xearth can also be configured to either create and
render into its own top-level X window or render directly into PPM or
GIF files; see the man page for details.
