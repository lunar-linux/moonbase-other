cat << EOF
Blosc is an extremely fast, multi-threaded, meta-compressor library.
It is a high performance compressor optimized for binary data. It has been
designed to transmit data to the processor cache faster than the traditional,
non-compressed, direct memory fetch approach via a memcpy() OS call. Blosc is
the first compressor (that I'm aware of) that is meant not only to reduce the
size of large datasets on-disk or in-memory, but also to accelerate memory-bound
computations.
