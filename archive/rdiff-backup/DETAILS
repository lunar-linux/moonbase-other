rdiff-backup backs up one directory to another,
possibly over a network. The target directory ends
up a copy of the source directory, but extra
reverse diffs are stored in a special subdirectory
of that target directory, so you can still recover
files lost some time ago. The idea is to combine
the best features of a mirror and an incremental
backup. rdiff-backup also preserves subdirectories,
hard links, dev files, permissions, uid/gid
ownership, modification times, extended attributes,
acls, and resource forks. Also, rdiff-backup can
operate in a bandwidth efficient manner over a
pipe, like rsync. Thus you can use rdiff-backup and
ssh to securely back a hard drive up to a remote
location, and only the differences will be
transmitted. Finally, rdiff-backup is easy to use
and settings have sensical defaults.
