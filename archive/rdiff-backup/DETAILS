rdiff-backup backs up one directory to another, possibly over a network.
The target directory ends up a copy of the source directory, but extra
reverse diffs are stored in a special subdirectory of that target
directory, so you can still recover files lost some time ago. The idea
is to combine the best features of a mirror and an incremental backup.
rdiff-backup also preserves subdirectories, hard links, dev files,
permissions, uid/gid ownership, modification times, extended attributes,
acls, and resource forks. Also, rdiff-backup can operate in a bandwidth
efficient manner over a pipe, like rsync. Thus you can use rdiff-backup
and ssh to securely back a hard drive up to a remote location, and only
the differences will be transmitted. Finally, rdiff-backup is easy to use
and settings have sensical defaults.
