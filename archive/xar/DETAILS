cat << EOF
The XAR project aims to provide an easily extensible archive format.
Important design decisions include an easily extensible XML table of
contents for random access to archived files, storing the toc at the
beginning of the archive to allow for efficient handling of streamed
archives, the ability to handle files of arbitrarily large sizes,
the ability to choose independent encodings for individual files
in the archive, the ability to store checksums for individual files
in both compressed and uncompressed form, and the ability to query
the table of content's rich meta-data.
