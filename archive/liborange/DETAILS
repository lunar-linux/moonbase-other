Orange is a tool and library for squeezing out juicy installable Microsoft
Cabinet Files from self-extracting installers for Microsoft Windows and some
other installer file formats. It currently supports the following kinds of
installers:

    * Self-extracting installers (EXE):
          o Early support for installers created by Installer VISE.
          o Support for some installers created by Inno Setup.
          o Setup Factory versions 5 and 6 using Dynamite for data decompression.
          o Some other installer (using a DLL called inflate.dll). This is used
            by for example Macromedia Flash Player 6 for Pocket PC 2002.
          o InstallShield self-extracting installers.
    * Other formats:
          o APK, ARH Early support for the installer used by TomTom products.
          o CAB InstallShield Cabinet files, using Unshield.
          o CAB Microsoft Cabinet files (also self-extracting) when you have
            Stuart Caie's excellent Cabextract tool installed.
          o MSI Microsoft Installer files, if libole2 is available.
          o RAR archives (also self-extracting) when you have Unrar installed.
          o ZIP archives (also self-extracting) when you have UnZip installed.
