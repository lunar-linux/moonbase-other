cat << EOF
The zziplib library offers the ability to easily extract data from files
archived in a single zip file. Applications can bundle files into a
single zip archive and access them. The implementation is based only on
the (free) subset of compression with the zlib algorithm which is
actually used by the zip/unzip tools.
