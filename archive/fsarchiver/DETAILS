FSArchiver is a system tool that allows you to save the contents of a 
file-system to a compressed archive file. The file-system can be 
restored on a partition which has a different size and it can be 
restored on a different file-system. Unlike tar/dar, FSArchiver also 
creates the file-system when it extracts the data to partitions. 
Everything is checksummed in the archive in order to protect the data.
If the archive is corrupt, you just loose the current file, not the 
whole archive.
