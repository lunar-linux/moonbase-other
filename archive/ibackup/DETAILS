cat << EOF
iBackup simplifies backing up the system configuration files (/etc) for 
UNIX systems (Solaris, *BSD, Linux). You can run the program from any 
directory, it will by default save the (maybe compressed) tarball to /root. 
It is possible to encrypt the tarball, to upload the tarball to some 
other host and run this backup automated in a cronjob. 
You could also send the backup by mail, using nail.
