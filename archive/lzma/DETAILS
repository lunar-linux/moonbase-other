cat << EOF
LZMA utils allows to use LZMA (de)compression tools in the same
way as gzip and bzip2 tools. The main purporse of the LZMA utils
is to make usage of the LZMA format as easy as possible for those
who are already familiar with gzip and bzip2.
The first step was lzmash, a small wrapper script,
which gave the LZMA encoder/decoder almost identical command line
interface than what gzip and bzip2 have.
As a whole LZMA utils provide a very similar command set than what
gzip and bzip2 packages have.
