This is the minizip from the contrib section of the zlib tarball. It only installs minizip
and nothing else.

 Note: This is the zlib from core. There are several apps such as Chromium with their
 own bundled version. I am not aware of any core modules that can make use of this
 so figured it would be better to separate the two.
