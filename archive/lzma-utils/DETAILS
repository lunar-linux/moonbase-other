    *  Average compression ratio of LZMA is about 30% better than that of gzip,
       and 15% better than that of bzip2.
    * Decompression speed is only little slower than that of gzip, being two to
      five times faster than bzip2.
    * In fast mode, compresses faster than bzip2 with a comparable compression 
      ratio.
    * Achieving the best compression ratios takes four to even twelve times 
      longer than with bzip2. However. this doesn't affect decompressing speed.
    * Command line interface very similar to those of gzip and bzip2.
    * The patch for GNU tar integrates LZMA compression with the tar command in
      the same way as with gzip and bzip2.
    * Free software licensed under the GNU GPL (actually most parts are under 
      the GNU LGPL).
