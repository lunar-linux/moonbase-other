Welcome to bbconf, the all-in-one blackbox configuration tool. Never heard of
blackbox before? Well, let's just say that it's the best Window Manager for X
that's out "there" in our humble opinion. Simply put, this little utility here 
has such lofty goals as being the one place where you can configure anything 
and everything you need to that has to do with blackbox.

bbconf aims to do that through the use of plugins--plugins which allow you to 
configure anything you wish about blackbox or its helper applications such as 
bbkeys, bbpager, bbapm, bbmail, bbpal, etc.

bbconf is distributed with 4 plugins that allow you to configure blackbox's 
keybindings, blackbox's styles/themes, and your blackbox menus and submenus. 

For keybindings support in blackbox you will also need bbkeys.
