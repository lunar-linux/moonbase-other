           SHORT="Lightweight and customizable notification daemon"

cat << EOF
Dunst is a lightweight replacement for the notification daemons provided by most
desktop environments.
It’s very customizable, isn’t dependent on any toolkits, and therefore fits into
those window manager centric setups we all love to customize to perfection.
