cat << EOF
Modular status bar for dwm written in c.
The statusbar is made from text output from commandline programs. Blocks are
added and removed by editing the config.h file.
Most statusbars constantly rerun every script every several seconds to update.
This is an option here, but a superior choice is giving your module a signal
that you can signal to it to update on a relevant event, rather than having it
rerun idly.
