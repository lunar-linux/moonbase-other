cat << EOF
FVWM is a multiple large virtual desktop window manager originally
derived from twm. FVWM is intended to have a small memory footprint and
a rich feature set, be extremely customizable and extendable and have a
high degree of Motif mwm compatibility. FVWM is highly extensible
through its module interface.

This is the standard FVWM 2.5.x with patches from http://abdn.ac.uk/~u15dm4/fvwm/ applied.
