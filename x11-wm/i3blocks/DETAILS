cat <<EOF
3blocks is a highly flexible status line for the i3 window manager. It handles
clicks, signals and language-agnostic user scripts.
The content of each block (e.g. time, battery status, network state, ...) is
the output of a command provided by the user. Blocks are updated on click, at
a given interval of time or on a given signal, also specified by the user.
It aims to respect the i3bar protocol, providing customization such as text
alignment, urgency, color, and more.
