cat <<EOF
i3's interprocess communication (or ipc) is the interface i3wm uses to receive
commands from client applications such as i3-msg. It also features a publish/
subscribe mechanism for notifying interested parties of window manager events.
i3ipc-python is a Python library for controlling the window manager.
This project is intended to be useful for general scripting, and for
applications that interact with the window manager like status line generators,
notification daemons, and pagers.
