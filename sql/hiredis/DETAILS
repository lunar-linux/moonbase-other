cat << EOF
Hiredis is a minimalistic C client library for the Redis database.

It is minimalistic because it just adds minimal support for the protocol,
but at the same time it uses a high level printf-alike API in order to make
it much higher level than otherwise suggested by its minimal code base and
the lack of explicit bindings for every Redis command.
