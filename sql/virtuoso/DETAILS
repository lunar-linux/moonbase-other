cat << EOF
At core, Virtuoso is a high-performance object-relational SQL database. As a database,
it provides transactions, a smart SQL compiler, powerful stored-procedure language with
optional Java and .Net server-side hosting, hot backup, SQL-99 support and more. It has
all major data-access interfaces, such as ODBC, JDBC, ADO .Net and OLE/DB.

Virtuoso has a built-in web server which can serve dynamic web pages written in Virtuoso's
web language (VSP) as well as PHP, ASP .net and others. This same web server provides SOAP
and REST access to Virtuoso stored procedures, supporting a broad set of WS protocols such
as WS-Security, WS-Reliable Messaging and others. A BPEL4WS run time is also available as 
part of Virtuoso's SOA suite.
