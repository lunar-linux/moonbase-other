cat << EOF
At core, Virtuoso is a high-performance object-relational SQL database. As a database,
it provides transactions, a smart SQL compiler, powerful stored-procedure language with
optional Java and .Net server-side hosting, hot backup, SQL-99 support and more. It has
all major data-access interfaces, such as ODBC, JDBC, ADO .Net and OLE/DB.

Virtuoso has a built-in web server which can serve dynamic web pages written in Virtuoso's
web language (VSP) as well as PHP, ASP .net and others. This same web server provides SOAP
and REST access to Virtuoso stored procedures, supporting a broad set of WS protocols such
as WS-Security, WS-Reliable Messaging and others. A BPEL4WS run time is also available as
part of Virtuoso's SOA suite.

Note:

You might want to run the following if you have problems getting Nepomuk and/or Strigi to
work. Its a bit brutish since it deletes some vitruosobackend stuff for ~/ and most likey
its best to logout/in of kde if that's where you are during this bump;

 akonadictl stop
 qdbus org.kde.NepomukServer /nepomukserver quit
 kbuildsycoca4 --noincremental
 rm ~/.kde/share/apps/nepomuk/repository/main/data/virtuosobackend/*
 nepomukservicestub nepomukstorage
 akonadictl start
