Technically speaking, FreeTDS is an open source implementation of the
TDS (Tabular DataStream) protocol used by these databases for their own
clients. It supports many different flavors of the protocol and supports
several APIs to access it. Additionally FreeTDS works with other software
such as Perl and PHP, providing access from those languages as well. There
is also a native (type 4) JDBC driver available for platform-independent
Java clients (including Java Server Pages applications), with support
for most of the JDBC 1 API and portions of the JDBC 2 API.
