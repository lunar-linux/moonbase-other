cat << EOF
SQLite is a C library that implements an SQL database engine. A large
subset of SQL92 is supported. A complete database is stored in a single
disk file. The API is designed for convenience and ease of use.
Applications that link against SQLite can enjoy the power and flexiblity
of an SQL database without the administrative hassles of supporting a
separate database server. Because it omits the client-server interaction
overhead and writes directly to disk, SQLite is also faster than the big
database servers for most operations. In addition to the C library, the
SQLite distribution includes a command-line tool for interacting with
SQLite databases and SQLite bindings for Tcl/Tk.
