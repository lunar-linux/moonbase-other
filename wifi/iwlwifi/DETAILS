cat << EOF
This project was created by Intel to enable support for the Intel
PRO/Wireless 3945ABG (IWL3945) and 4965AGN (IWL4965) Network Connection
adapter. This project is intended to be a community effort as much as is
possible given some working constraints (mainly, no HW documentation is
available).
