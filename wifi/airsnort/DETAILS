AirSnort is a wireless LAN (WLAN) tool which recovers encryption keys. 
AirSnort operates by passively monitoring transmissions, computing the 
encryption key when enough packets have been gathered. 
802.11b, using the Wired Equivalent Protocol (WEP), is crippled with 
numerous security flaws. Most damning of these is the weakness described 
in "Weaknesses in the Key Scheduling Algorithm of RC4" by Scott Fluhrer, 
Itsik Mantin and Adi Shamir. Adam Stubblefield was the first to implement 
this attack, but he has not made his software public. AirSnort, along with 
WEPCrack, which was released about the same time as AirSnort, are the 
first publicly available implementaions of this attack. 
AirSnort requires approximately 5-10 million encrypted packets to be 
gathered. Once enough packets have been gathered, AirSnort can guess the 
encryption password in under a second.
