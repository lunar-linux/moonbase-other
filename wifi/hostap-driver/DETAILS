           SHORT="A Linux driver for Prism2/2.5/3 wireless LAN cards"

cat << EOF
This is a Linux driver for wireless LAN cards based on Intersil's
Prism2/2.5/3 chipset. The driver supports a so called Host AP mode,
i.e., it takes care of IEEE 802.11 management functions in the host
computer and acts as an access point. This does not require any special
firmware for the wireless LAN card. In addition to this, it has support
for normal station operations in BSS and possible also in IBSS.
