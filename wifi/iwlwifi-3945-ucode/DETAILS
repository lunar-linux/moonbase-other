cat << EOF
This project was created by Intel to enable support for the Intel
PRO/Wireless 3945ABG (IWL3945) Network Connection adapter. This project is
intended to be a community effort as much as is possible given some working
constraints (mainly, no HW documentation is available).

This contains the REQUIRED binary micro code that is uploaded to the card upon
initialization.
