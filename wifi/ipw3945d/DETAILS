This project was created by Intel to enable support for the Intel
PRO/Wireless 3945ABG (IPW3945) Network Connection adapter. This project is
intended to be a community effort as much as is possible given some working
constraints (mainly, no HW documentation is available).

This is the binary user space regulatory daemon, that is REQUIRED for using
the Intel 3945ABG adapter in Linux.
