The GNUstep Base Library is a library of general-purpose,
non-graphical Objective C objects.  For example, it includes classes
for strings, object collections, byte streams, typed coders,
invocations, notifications, notification dispatchers, moments in time,
network ports, remote object messaging support (distributed objects),
and event loops.

Note: you will need to have built gcc with the Objective-C option
to be able to build GNUstep modules. These modules have been built
according to http://gnustep.made-it.com/BuildGuide/ but are untested.
You will also need to customize the GNUstep environment before use.
