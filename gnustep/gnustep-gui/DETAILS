cat << EOF
The GNUstep gui library is a library of graphical user
interface classes written completely in the Objective-C
language; the classes are based upon Apple's Cocoa
framwork (which came from the OpenStep specification).
These classes include graphical objects such as buttons,
text fields, popup lists, browser lists, and windows;
there are also many associated classes for handling events,
colors, fonts, pasteboards and images.
