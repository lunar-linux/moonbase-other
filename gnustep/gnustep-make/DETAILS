cat << EOF
GNUstep-make allows the user to write a project without having to
deal with the complex issues associated with configuration, building,
installation, and packaging.  It also allows the user to easily create
cross-compiled binaries.

Note: you will need to have built gcc with the Objective-C option
to be able to build GNUstep modules. These modules have been built
according to http://gnustep.made-it.com/BuildGuide/ but are untested.
You will also need to customise the GNUstep environment before use.
