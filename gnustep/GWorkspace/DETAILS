GWorkspace is the official GNUstep workspace manager. It is a clone
of NeXT's workspace manager and already ready for daily usage.

GWorkspace is probably one of the most useful and usable workspace
managers available on any platform, owing to its well-designed
interface and the natural, consistent design that it inherits from
the GNUstep framework.

Note: you will need to have built gcc with the Objective-C option
to be able to build GNUstep modules. These modules have been built
according to http://gnustep.made-it.com/BuildGuide/ but are untested.
You will also need to customize the GNUstep environment before use.
