cat << EOF
libcg aims to provide programmers easily usable APIs to use the control
group file system. It should satisfy the following requirements:
 - Provide a programmable interface for cgroups
   This should allow applications to create cgroups using something like
   create_cgroup() as opposed to having to go the whole filesystem route.
 - Provide persistent configuration across reboots
   Control Groups have a lifetime of only one boot cycle. The configuration
   is lost at reboot. Userspace needs to handle this issue.
   This is handled by libcg.
 - Provide a programmable interface for manipulating configurations
   This should allow libcg to handle changing application requirements.
   For example, while gaming, you might want to reduce the cpu power of other
   groups whereas othertimes you would want greater CPU power for those groups.
