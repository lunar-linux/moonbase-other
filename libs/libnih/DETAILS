cat << EOF
libnih is a small library for C application development containing
functions that, despite its name, are not implemented elsewhere in
the standard library set.

libnih is roughly equivalent to other C libraries such as glib,
except that its focus is on a small size and intended for
applications that sit very low in the software stack, especially
outside of /usr.
