cat << EOF
LMDB is an ultra-fast, ultra-compact key-value embedded data store developed by Symas
for the OpenLDAP Project. It uses memory-mapped files, so it has the read performance
of a pure in-memory database while still offering the persistence of standard disk-based
databases, and is only limited to the size of the virtual address space, (it is not
limited to the size of physical RAM). 

Note: LMDB was originally called MDB, but was renamed to avoid confusion with other 
software associated with the name MDB
