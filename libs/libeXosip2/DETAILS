cat << EOF
eXosip is a library that hides the complexity of using the SIP protocol
for multimedia session establishment. This protocol is mainly to be
used by VoIP telephony applications (end-point or conference server) but
might be also useful for any applications that wish to establish
sessions like multiplayer games.
