cat << EOF
OpenGL Mathematics (GLM) is a header only C++ mathematics library
for graphics software based on the OpenGL Shading Language (GLSL)
specifications.  This project isn't limited to GLSL features. 
An extension system, based on the GLSL extension conventions, 
provides extended capabilities: matrix transformations, quaternions, 
data packing, random numbers, noise, etc...

This library works perfectly with OpenGL but it also ensures 
interoperability with other third party libraries and SDK. 
It is a good candidate for software rendering (raytracing / rasterisation),
image processing, physic simulations and any development context that 
requires a simple and convenient mathematics library.
