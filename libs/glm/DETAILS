cat << EOF
OpenGL Mathematics (GLM) is a header only C++ mathematics library for graphics
software based on the OpenGL Shading Language (GLSL) specifications.  This
project isn't limited to GLSL features. 

An extension system, based on the GLSL extension conventions, provides extended
capabilities: matrix transformations, quaternions, data packing, random numbers,
noise, etc...

This library works perfectly with OpenGL but it also ensures interoperability with
other third party libraries and SDK. It is a good candidate for software rendering
(raytracing / rasterisation), image processing, physic simulations and any development
context that requires a simple and convenient mathematics library.
