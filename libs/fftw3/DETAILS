cat << EOF
FFTW is a fast C FFT library. It includes complex, real, and parallel
transforms, and can handle arbitrary array sizes efficiently. FFTW is
typically faster than other publically-available FFT implementations,
and is even competitive with vendor-tuned libraries (benchmarks are
available at the homepage). To achieve this performance, FFTW uses
novel code-generation and runtime self-optimization techniques (along
with many other tricks).
