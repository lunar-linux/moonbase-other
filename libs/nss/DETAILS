The Network Security Services (NSS) package is a set of libraries designed to
support cross-platform development of security-enabled client and server
applications. Applications built with NSS can support SSL v2 and v3, TLS, PKCS #5,
PKCS #7, PKCS #11, PKCS #12, S/MIME, X.509 v3 certificates, and other
security standards. This is useful for implementing SSL and S/MIME or other
Internet security standards into an application.
