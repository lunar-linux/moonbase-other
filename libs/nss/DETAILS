The Network Security Services (NSS) package is a set of libraries
designed to support cross-platform development of security-enabled
client and server applications. Applications built with NSS can
support SSL v2 and v3, TLS, PKCS #5, PKCS #7, PKCS #11, PKCS #12,
S/MIME, X.509 v3 certificates, and other security standards. This
is useful for implementing SSL and S/MIME or other Internet security
standards into an application.
