cat << EOF
GTS stands for the GNU Triangulated Surface Library. It is an Open Source Free
Software Library intended to provide a set of useful functions to deal with 3D
surfaces meshed with interconnected triangles. The source code is available
free of charge under the Free Software LGPL license.

The code is written entirely in C with an object-oriented approach based mostly
on the design of GTK+. Careful attention is paid to performance related issues
as the initial goal of GTS is to provide a simple and efficient library to
scientists dealing with 3D computational surface meshes.

A brief summary of its main features:

    * Simple object-oriented structure giving easy access to topological
      properties.
    * 2D dynamic Delaunay and constrained Delaunay triangulations.
    * Robust geometric predicates (orientation, in circle) using fast adaptive
      floating point arithmetic (adapted from the fine work of Jonathan R.
      Shewchuk).
    * Robust set operations on surfaces (union, intersection, difference).
    * Surface refinement and coarsening (multiresolution models).
    * Dynamic view-independent continuous level-of-detail.
    * Preliminary support for view-dependent level-of-detail.
    * Bounding-boxes trees and Kd-trees for efficient point location and
      collision/intersection detection.
    * Graph operations: traversal, graph partitioning.
    * Metric operations (area, volume, curvature ...).
    * Triangle strips generation for fast rendering.
