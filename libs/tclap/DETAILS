cat << EOF
TCLAP is a small, flexible library that provides a simple interface for defining
and accessing command line arguments. It was intially inspired by the user 
friendly CLAP libary. The difference is that this library is templatized, so the 
argument class is type independent. Type independence avoids 
identical-except-for-type objects, such as IntArg, FloatArg, and StringArg. While 
the library is not strictly compliant with the GNU or POSIX standards, it is close.
