cat << EOF
The mission of the Apache Portable Runtime (APR) project is to create and
maintain software libraries that provide a predictable and consistent interface
to underlying platform-specific implementations. The primary goal is to provide
an API to which software developers may code and be assured of predictable if
not identical behaviour regardless of the platform on which their software is
built, relieving them of the need to code special-case conditions to work
around or take advantage of platform-specific deficiencies or features.
