cat << EOF
mowgli is a development framework for C (like GLib), which provides high
performance and highly flexible algorithms. It can be used as a suppliment
to GLib (to add additional functions (dictionaries, hashes), or replace
some of the slow GLib list manipulation functions), or stand alone. It also
provides a powerful hook system and convenient logging for your code, as
well as a high performance block allocator.

mowgli builds upon previous attempts, such as libmisc, and will likely
become the primary development framework for most projects at Atheme.
