cat << EOF
Parsifal is a validating XML 1.0 parser written in ANSI C. Parsifal API
is based on SAX2.

Parsifal can be used for parsing XML based messages (such as REST and RSS)
and for application specific data processing e.g. config files, data files
etc.  Parsifal can also be used for document-oriented processing (e.g.
XHTML xhtml1-transitional.dtd) and for parsing modular documents because
it is conforming XML 1.0 parser and it supports features like internal and
external general entities, DTD parameter entities and default attributes
etc. Parsifal is ideal for processing large data files and streams since
it's SAX based and consumes very little memory not to mention it is fast
enough for most purposes 'cos it's written in C.
