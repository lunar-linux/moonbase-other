cat << EOF
unicap provides a uniform interface to video capture devices. It allows
applications to use any supported video capture device via a single API.

Building applications with a graphical user interface is made especially
easy with the unicapGTK widget set.

The ucil library provides easy to use functions to render text and graphic
overlays onto video images.

unicap offers a high level of hardware abstraction while maintaining maximum
performance. Zero copy capture of video buffers is possible for devices
supporting it allowing fast video capture with low CPU usage even on
low-speed architectures.

unicap is dual licensed under the terms and conditions of the General Public
License (GPL) and a commercial license.
