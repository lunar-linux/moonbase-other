cat << EOF
STFL is a library which implements a curses-based widget set for text terminals.
The STFL API can be used from C, SPL, Python, Perl and Ruby.
Since the API is only 14 simple function calls big and there are already generic
SWIG bindings it is very easy to port STFL to additional scripting languages.
