cat << EOF
wxGTK - GTK+ implementation of wxWindows API for GUI's.
wxWindows provides online help, network programming, streams, clipboard
and drag and drop, multithreading, image loading and saving in a variety
of formats, database support, HTML viewing and printing.  Quite good for
a GUI API.
NOTE: Leave this module alone if you don't know what you are doing! The
reason this module uses wxPython source code is that it saves downloading
as wxPython INCLUDES all of wxGTK. This also saves time building wxPython
as it needs the wxGTK that is included in the wxPython source code.
