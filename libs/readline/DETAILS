readline - Lets users edit command lines as they are typed in
The Readline library provides a set of functions for use by applications
that allow users to edit command lines as they are typed in. Both Emacs
and vi editing modes are available. The Readline library includes
additional functions to maintain a list of previously-entered command
lines, to recall and perhaps reedit those lines, and perform csh-like
history expansion on previous commands.
