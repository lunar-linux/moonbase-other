cat << EOF
The Computational Geometry Algorithms Library (CGAL), offers data structures and
algorithms like triangulations (2D constrained triangulations and Delaunay
triangulations in 2D and 3D, periodic triangulations in 3D), Voronoi diagrams
(for 2D and 3D points, 2D additively weighted Voronoi diagrams, and segment
Voronoi diagrams), polygons (Boolean operations, offsets, straight skeleton),
polyhedra (Boolean operations), arrangements of curves and their applications (2D
and 3D envelopes, Minkowski sums), mesh generation (2D Delaunay mesh generation
and 3D surface and volume mesh generation, skin surfaces), geometry processing
(surface mesh simplification, subdivision and parameterization, as well as
estimation of local differential properties, and approximation of ridges and
umbilics), alpha shapes, convex hull algorithms (in 2D, 3D and dD), search
structures (kd trees for nearest neighbor search, and range and segment trees),
interpolation (natural neighbor interpolation and placement of streamlines), shape
analysis, fitting, and distances (smallest enclosing sphere of points or spheres,
smallest enclosing ellipsoid of points, principal component analysis), and kinetic
data structures.
