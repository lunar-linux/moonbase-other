The Computational Geometry Algorithms Library (CGAL), offers data structures and
algorithms like triangulations (2D constrained triangulations and Delaunay 
triangulations in 2D and 3D, periodic triangulations in 3D), Voronoi diagrams 
(for 2D and 3D points, 2D additively weighted Voronoi diagrams, and segment 
Voronoi diagrams), polygons (Boolean operations, offsets, straight skeleton), 
polyhedra (Boolean operations), arrangements of curves and their applications (2D 
and 3D envelopes, Minkowski sums), mesh generation (2D Delaunay mesh generation 
and 3D surface and volume mesh generation, skin surfaces), geometry processing 
(surface mesh simplification, subdivision and parameterization, as well as 
estimation of local differential properties, and approximation of ridges and 
umbilics), alpha shapes, convex hull algorithms (in 2D, 3D and dD), search 
structures (kd trees for nearest neighbor search, and range and segment trees), 
interpolation (natural neighbor interpolation and placement of streamlines), shape 
analysis, fitting, and distances (smallest enclosing sphere of points or spheres, 
smallest enclosing ellipsoid of points, principal component analysis), and kinetic 
data structures.
