cat << EOF
Eet is a tiny library designed to write an arbitary set of chunks of
data to a file and optionally compress each chunk (very much like a
zip file) and allow fast random-access reading of the file later on.
It does not do zip as a zip itself has more complexity than is needed,
and it was much simpler to impliment this once here.
