cat << EOF
libx86 - a hardware-independent library for executing real-mode x86
code. It's often useful to be able to make real-mode x86 BIOS calls
from userland. lrmi provides a simple interface to this for x86
machines, but this doesn't help on other platforms. libx86 provides
the lrmi interface, but will also run on platforms such as amd64 and
alpha.
