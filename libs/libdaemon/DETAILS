cat << EOF
libdaemon is a lightweight C library that eases the writing of UNIX
daemons. It consists of the following parts:

* A wrapper around fork() which does the correct daemonization procedure
  of a process
* A wrapper around syslog() for simpler and compatible log output to
  Syslog or STDERR * An API for writing PID files
* An API for serializing UNIX signals into a pipe for usage with
  select() or poll()
* An API for running subprocesses with STDOUT and STDERR redirected to
  syslog.

APIs like these are used in most daemon software available. It is not
that simple to get it done right and code duplication is not a goal.
