cat << EOF
libavc1394 is a programming interface to the AV/C specification from
the 1394 Trade Assocation. AV/C stands for Audio/Video Control. Currently,
applications use the library to control the tape transport mechansim on DV
camcorders. However, there are many devices and functions of devices that
can be controlled via AV/C. Eventually, the library will be expanded to
implement more of the specification and to provide high level interfaces
to various devices.
