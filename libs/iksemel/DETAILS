cat << EOF
iksemel is an XML (eXtensible Markup Language) parser library designed for 
Jabber applications.

Some features:

    * Highly portable, builds on all POSIX environments and Windows (via mingw). 

    * Suitable for embedded systems. Code is small and highly modular, you can 
      trim unneeded parts. Memory usage is low, parser is quite fast. 

    * Provides SAX, DOM and XMPP parsers. 

    * TLS (via gnutls) and SASL support for XMPP security. 

    * Only UTF8 encoding is built-in supported. 

    * Fully documented with examples.
