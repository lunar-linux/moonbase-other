cat << EOF
iksemel is an XML (eXtensible Markup Language) parser library designed for
Jabber applications.

Some features:

    * Highly portable, builds on all POSIX environments and Windows (via mingw).

    * Suitable for embedded systems. Code is small and highly modular, you can
      trim unneeded parts. Memory usage is low, parser is quite fast.

    * Provides SAX, DOM and XMPP parsers.

    * TLS (via gnutls) and SASL support for XMPP security.

    * Only UTF8 encoding is built-in supported.

    * Fully documented with examples.
