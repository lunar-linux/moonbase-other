After many months of hard work, the first release of libiec61883 is now
available. This library provides third generation media reception and
transmission for DV, MPEG2-TS, and AMDTP (audio and music) using only raw1394
and not the complicated setup and maintenance of other kernel modules and their
/dev nodes. This is not just an early development release. It is already quite
capable and robust. Already, MythTV 0.17 supports MPEG2-TS, FreeBob is using
AMDTP, and a soon-to-be-released dvgrab 2.0 is being used in a heavy, 24/7
production environment. We encourage all developers and applications to migrate
to this library as support for dv1394, amdtp, and cmp modules are being phased
out as well as DV and MPEG2-TS applications of video1394.
