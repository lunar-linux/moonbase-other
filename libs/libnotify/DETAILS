cat << EOF
The Desktop Notifications framework provides a standard way of doing
passive pop-up notifications on the Linux desktop.  These are designed
to notify the user of something without interrupting their work with a
dialog box that they must close.  Passive popups can automatically
disappear after a short period of time.  This project consists of a
specification and implementation (libnotify and notification-daemon).
