cat << EOF
pakchois is just another PKCS #11 wrapper library. It aims to provide
a thin wrapper over the PKCS#11 interface. The goals are as follows:

 1. to offer a modern object-oriented C interface wrapper for PKCS#11
 2. to not hide or abstract away any details of the PKCS#11 interface
    itself except where absolutely necessary
 3. to handle the details of loading DSOs
 4. to allow the caller to avoid caring about where on the system
    PKCS#11 modules might be stored, or exactly how they are named
 5. to avoid any dependency on a particular cryptography toolkit

Existing PKCS#11 wrapper libraries solutions differ in at least one of the above goals.
