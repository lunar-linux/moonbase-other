Swfdec is a library for rendering Flash animations and games. It was originally
designed as a basis library for creating Flash plugins for GStreamer, but it is
a fully standalone library which only use the libart library for drawing.
Swfdec is released under the LGPL. Included with swfdec is Gtk+-based
application called swf_play and a Mozilla plug-in that uses swf_play to display
SWF animations in a browser window.
