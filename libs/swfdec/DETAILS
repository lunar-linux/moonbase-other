Swfdec is a library for rendering Flash animations and games. It was 
originally designed as a basis library for creating Flash plugins for 
GStreamer, but it is a fully standalone library which only use the l
ibart library for drawing. Swfdec is released under the LGPL. Included 
with swfdec is Gtk+-based application called swf_play and a Mozilla 
plug-in that uses swf_play to display SWF animations in a browser window.
