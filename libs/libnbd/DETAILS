cat << EOF
NBD (Network Block Device) is a protocol for accessing Block Devices
(hard disks and disk-like things) over a Network.  This is the NBD
client library in userspace, a simple library for writing NBD clients.

The key features are:
* Synchronous API for ease of use.
* Asynchronous API for writing non-blocking, multithreaded clients.
  You can mix both APIs freely.
* High performance.
* Minimal dependencies for the basic library.
* Well-documented, stable API.
* Bindings in several programming languages.
* Shell (nbdsh) for command line and scripting.
* Copying tool (nbdcopy) for high performance copying and streaming.
* Hexdump tool (nbddump) to print NBD content.
* Query tool (nbdinfo) to query NBD servers.
* FUSE support (nbdfuse) to mount NBD in the local filesystem.
* Linux ublk support (nbdublk) to create the userspace block device.
