cat << EOF
Libblockdev is a C library supporting GObject introspection for manipulation of
block devices. It has a plugin-based architecture where each technology (like
LVM, Btrfs, MD RAID, Swap,...) is implemented in a separate plugin, possibly
with multiple implementations (e.g. using LVM CLI or the new LVM DBus API).
