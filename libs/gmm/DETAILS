cat << EOF
Gmm++ is a generic C++ template library for sparse, dense and
skyline matrices. It is built as a set of generic algorithms
(mult, add, copy, sub-matrices, dense and sparse solvers ...) for
any interfaced vector type or matrix type. It can be view as a
glue library allowing cooperation between several vector and matrix
types. However, basic sparse, dense and skyline matrix/vector types are
built in Gmm++, hence it can be used as a standalone linear algebra
library. Interfacing a vector or matrix type means writing "traits"
objects called "linalg_traits", which describe their properties. The
library offers predefined dense, sparse and skyline matrix types.
