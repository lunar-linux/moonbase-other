cat << EOF
librsync is a free software library that implements the rsync
remote-delta algorithm. This algorithm allows efficient remote
updates of a file, without requiring the old and new versions
to both be present at the sending end. The library uses a
"streaming" design similar to that of zlib with the aim of
allowing it to be embedded into many different applications.
