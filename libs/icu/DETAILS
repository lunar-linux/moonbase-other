ICU is a mature, widely used set of C/C++ and Java libraries for Unicode 
support, software internationalization and globalization (i18n/g11n). It 
grew out of the JDK 1.1 internationalization APIs, which the ICU team 
contributed, and the project continues to be developed for the most advanced 
Unicode/i18n support. ICU is widely portable and gives applications the same 
results on all platforms and between C/C++ and Java software
