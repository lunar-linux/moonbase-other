AqBanking has two major goals which are described in the following paragraphs.

1. Generic Online Banking Interface:

The intention of AqBanking is to provide a middle layer between the program
and the various Online Banking libraries (e.g. AqHBCI, OpenHBCI etc).

The real work is done in banking backends.
One such backend is AqHBCI, a library which implements a client for the
German HBCI (Home Banking Computer Interface) protocol.

The backend AqHBCI currently supports these security media:
 - RDH keyfile (RSA-DES-Hybrid mode)
 - DDV chipcard (DES-DES-Verfahren)
 - OpenHBCI keyfile (either OpenHBCI 1 or 2, this medium allows continued use
                     with OpenHBCI in parallel)
 - PIN/TAN file (PIN/TAN mode using HTTP over SSL)

2. Generic Financial Data Importer/Exporter Framework:

AqBanking uses various plugins to simplify import and export of financial
data. It also provides the administration of profiles on a per import/export
plugin basis.

There are import plugins for the following formats:
 - DTAUS (German financial format)
 - SWIFT (MT940 and MT942)
and others.
