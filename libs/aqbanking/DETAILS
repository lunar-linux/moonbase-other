AqBanking has two major goals which are described in the following paragraphs. 

1. Generic Online Banking Interface:

The intention of AqBanking is to provide a middle layer between the program
and the various Online Banking libraries (e.g. AqHBCI, OpenHBCI etc). 

The real work is done in banking backends. 
The first backend which is already supported is AqHBCI, a library which 
implements a client for the German HBCI (Home Banking Computer Interface) 
protocol. 

The backend AqHBCI currently supports these security media: 
 - RDH keyfile (RSA-DES-Hybrid mode)
 - DDV chipcard (DES-DES-Verfahren)
 - OpenHBCI keyfile (either OpenHBCI 1 or 2, this medium allows continued use 
                     with OpenHBCI in parallel) 
 - PIN/TAN file (PIN/TAN mode using HTTP over SSL)

2. Generic Financial Data Importer/Exporter Framework:

AqBanking uses various plugins to simplify import and export of financial
data. It also provides the administration of profiles on a per import/export
plugin basis.

Currently there are import plugins for the following formats: 
 - DTAUS (German financial format)
 - SWIFT (MT940 and MT942)
