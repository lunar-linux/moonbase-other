cat << EOF
libConfuse is a configuration file parser library, and written in C.
It supports sections and (lists of) values 
(strings, integers, floats, booleans or other sections), 
as well as some other features (such as single/double-quoted strings, 
environment variable expansion, functions and nested include statements).
It makes it very easy to add configuration file capability 
to a program using a simple API.
