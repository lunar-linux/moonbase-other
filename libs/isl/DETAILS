cat << EOF
isl is a library for manipulating sets and relations of integer points
bounded by linear constraints. Supported operations on sets include
intersection, union, set difference, emptiness check, convex hull,
(integer) affine hull, integer projection, computing the lexicographic
minimum using parametric integer programming, coalescing and parametric
vertex enumeration. It also includes an ILP solver based on generalized
basis reduction, transitive closures on maps (which may encode infinite
graphs), dependence analysis and bounds on piecewise step-polynomials.
