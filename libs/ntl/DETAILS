NTL is a high-performance, portable C++ library providing data structures
and algorithms for arbitrary length integers; for vectors, matrices, and
polynomials over the integers and over finite fields; and for arbitrary
precision floating point arithmetic.

NTL provides high quality implementations of state-of-the-art algorithms for:

    * arbitrary length integer arithmetic and arbitrary precision floating
      point arithmetic;
    * polynomial arithmetic over the integers and finite fields including
      basic arithmetic, polynomial factorization, irreducibility testing,
      computation of minimal polynomials, traces, norms, and more;
    * lattice basis reduction, including very robust and fast
      implementations of Schnorr-Euchner, block Korkin-Zolotarev reduction,
      and the new Schnorr-Horner pruning heuristic for block Korkin-Zolotarev;
    * basic linear algebra over the integers, finite fields, and arbitrary
      precision floating point numbers.
