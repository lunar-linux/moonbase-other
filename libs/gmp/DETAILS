GNUmp is a library operating on signed integers, rational numbers, and
floating point numbers. All functions have a standardized interface.
GNUmp is designed to be as fast as possible by using fullwords as the
basic arithmetic type, by using fast algorithms, by carefully optimizing
assembly code for the most common inner loops for many CPUs, and by a
general emphasis on speed (as opposed to simplicity or elegance).
GNUmp's speed advantage increases with the operand size, since GNUmp in
many cases has asymptomatically faster algorithms.
