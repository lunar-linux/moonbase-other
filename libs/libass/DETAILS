SubStation Alpha, abbreviated SSA, is a subtitle file format created by Kotus
that allows for more advanced subtitles than the conventional SRT and similar
formats.
Advanced SubStation Alpha (ASS) is a script that lets you create even more
advanced subtitles than SSA. It is technically SSA v4+. The main feature of
ASS is that it has more specifications than normal SSA, like in styles
programming.

libASS is a portable library that provides rendering functions for these
subtitle formats.
