Cdk stands for 'Curses Development Kit' and it currently contains 21 ready
to use widgets which facilitate the speedy development of full screen
curses programs. This little project of mine started as a test to see how
compatible my Linux machine was to other UNIX breeds. While doing this I
discovered Ncurses, and played with it.
