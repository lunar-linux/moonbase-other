cat << EOF
libLASi is a library written by Larry Siden that provides a C++ stream output interface 
( with operator << ) for creating Postscript documents that can contain characters from 
any of the scripts and symbol blocks supported in Unicode and by Owen Taylor's Pango 
layout engine. 
The library accomodates right-to-left scripts such as Arabic and Hebrew as easily as 
left-to-right scripts. Indic and Indic-derived Complex Text Layout (CTL) scripts, such 
as Devanagari, Thai, Lao, and Tibetan are supported to the extent provided by Pango and 
by the OpenType fonts installed on your system. All of this is provided without need for 
any special configuration or layout calculation on the programmer's part.
