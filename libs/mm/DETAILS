           SHORT="A library for sharing memory between related processes"

cat << EOF
The OSSP MM library is a 2-layer abstraction library which simplifies the
usage of shared memory between forked processes under Unix
platforms. On the first layer it hides all platform dependent implementation
details (allocation and locking) when dealing with shared memory
segments and on the second layer it provides a high-level malloc(3)-style
API for a convenient and well known way to work with data-structures inside
those shared memory segments.
