           SHORT="DSP functions for telephony"

cat << EOF
Spandsp is a library of many DSP functions for telephony. These range from
simple modules, such as DTMF detection, to a complete software FAX machine.

Unicall is an abstraction layer for telephony signaling, and some telephony
protocol modules to go with it. The key module right now is MFC/R2.
