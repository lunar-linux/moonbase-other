cat << EOF
OpenEXR is a high dynamic-range (HDR) image file format developed by
Industrial Light & Magic for use in computer imaging applications.
OpenEXR's features include:
  - Higher dynamic range and color precision than existing 8 and 10-bit
  image file formats.
  - Support for 16-bit floating-point, 32-bit floating-point, and 32-bit
  integer pixels. The 16-bit floating-point format, called "half", is
  compatible with the half data type in NVIDIA's Cg graphics language
  and is supported natively on their new GeForce FX and Quadro FX 3D
  graphics solutions.
  - Multiple lossless image compression algorithms. Some of the included
  codecs can achieve 2:1 lossless compression ratios on images with film
  grain.
  - Extensibility. New compression codecs and image types can easily be
  added by extending the C++ classes included in the OpenEXR software
  distribution. New image attributes (strings, vectors, integers, etc.)
  can be added to OpenEXR image headers without affecting backward
  compatibility with existing OpenEXR applications.
