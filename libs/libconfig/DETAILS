            SHORT="A simple library for processing structured configuration files"

cat << EOF
Libconfig is a simple library for processing structured configuration files.
This file format is more compact and more readable than XML. And unlike XML, it
is type-aware, so it is not necessary to do string parsing in application code.

Libconfig is very compact – a fraction of the size of the expat XML parser
library. This makes it well-suited for memory-constrained systems like handheld
devices.

The library includes bindings for both the C and C++ languages. It works on
POSIX-compliant UNIX and UNIX-like systems (GNU/Linux, Mac OS X, FreeBSD),
Android, and Windows (2000, XP and later).
