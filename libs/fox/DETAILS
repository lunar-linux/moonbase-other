cat << EOF
FOX stands for Free Objects for X. It is a C++ based class library for
building Graphical User Interfaces. Developing Graphical User Interfaces
is a fairly complicated process. FOX reduces the burden on the developer
significantly. FOX provides a rich set of Widgets, and moreover, this set
is easily extensible by application programmers.
