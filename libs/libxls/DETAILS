libxls is a C library which can read Excel (xls) files. It has been tested on 
Linux x86 and Cygwin but may work on any little-endian system. It is not 
compatible with big endian systems.

libxls can read excel files since Excel 97 (the BIFF8 format)

libxls cannot write Excel files.

libxls is also shipped with xls2csv, a tool which converts an xls file to a csv
format, more suitable for parsing.
