cat << EOF
UCommon is meant as a very light-weight C++ library to facilitate using C++ 
design patterns even for very deeply embedded applications, such as for 
systems using uclibc along with posix threading support. For this reason, 
UCommon disables language features that consume memory or introduce runtime 
overhead, such as rtti and exception handling, and assumes one will mostly be
linking applications with other pure C based libraries rather than using the 
overhead of the standard C++ library and other similar class frameworks.
