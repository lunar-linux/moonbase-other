Gmerlin Audio Video Library. It is a low level library, upon which multimedia
APIs can be built. Gavl handles all the details of audio and video formats
like colorspaces, samplerates, multichannel configurations etc. It provides
standardized definitions for those formats as well as container structures for
carrying audio samples or video images inside an application.
