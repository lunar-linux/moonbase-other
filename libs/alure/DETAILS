ALURE is a utility library to help manage common tasks with OpenAL applications.
This includes device enumeration and initialization, file loading, and streaming.
As of version 1.1, it is X11/MIT licensed, allowing it to be used in open- and 
closed-source programs, freeware or commercial.

The purpose of this library is to provide pre-made functionality that would 
otherwise be repetitive or difficult to (re)code for various projects and 
platforms, such as loading a sound file into an OpenAL buffer and streaming an 
audio file through a buffer queue. Support for different formats is consistant 
across platforms, so no special checks are needed when loading files, and all 
formats are handled through the same API.

Currently ALURE includes a basic .wav and .aif file reader, and can leverage 
external libraries such as libSndFile (for extended wave formats and several 
others), VorbisFile (for Ogg Vorbis), FLAC (for FLAC and Ogg FLAC), and others. 
External libraries can also be dynamically loaded at run-time, or individually 
disabled outright at compile time.
