Judy is a C library that provides a state-of-the-art core technology that implements a sparse
dynamic array. Judy arrays are declared simply with a null pointer. A Judy array consumes memory
only when it is populated, yet can grow to take advantage of all available memory if desired.

Judy's key benefits are scalability, high performance, and memory efficiency. A Judy array is
extensible and can scale up to a very large number of elements, bounded only by machine memory.
Since Judy is designed as an unbounded array, the size of a Judy array is not pre-allocated but
grows and shrinks dynamically with the array population.
