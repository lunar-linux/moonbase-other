cat << EOF
Gwenhywfar is a multi-platform helper library for networking and
security applications and libraries. Gwenhywfar includes the following 
features:

- Basic Data types for binary buffers, ring buffers, linked lists, 
  error objects, string lists (src/base/), buffered IO operations (src/io/)

- Macros for typesafe list management

- OS abstraction functions for directory and Internet address handling
  and library loading (src/os/)

- Networking functions which allow to manage many connections to be used
  economically even in single threaded applications

- High-level functions for parsing files with a simplified "XML-like"
  format and accessing them like a hierarchical database (src/parser/)

- High-level cryptographic functions on top of OpenSSL functionality
  (src/crypt/)

- Support for interprocess communication (HTTP on top of SSL or plain
  TCP/UDP sockets)

- Console user-interface (including a simple HTML parser) based on
  ncurses
