libdmtx is open source software for reading and writing Data Matrix 2D barcodes
on Linux, Unix, OS X, Windows, and mobile devices. At its core libdmtx is a
shared library, allowing C/C++ programs to use its capabilities without
restrictions or overhead.

The included utility programs, dmtxread and dmtxwrite, provide the official
interface to libdmtx from the command line, and also serve as a reference for
programmers who wish to write their own programs that use libdmtx. All software
in the libdmtx package is distributed under the LGPLv2 license and can be used
freely under these terms.
