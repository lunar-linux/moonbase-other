cat << EOF
It uses the rich type system of Objective Caml 3 to provide a strongly typed,
yet very comfortable, object-oriented interface to gtk+. This is not that easy
if you know the dynamic typing approach taken by gtk+.

It is still under development, but already fully functional. All widgets
(but one) are available, with almost all their methods. The GLArea widget is
also supported in combination with LablGL. LibGlade and GdkPixbuf support is
also included for both versions. LablGTK2 adds support for gnomecanvas,
librsvg and libpanel Many examples are provided.

Objective Caml threads are supported, including for the toplevel, which allows
for interactive use of the library.
