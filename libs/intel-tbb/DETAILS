cat << EOF
Intel Threading Building Blocks (Intel TBB) offers a rich and complete approach
to expressing parallelism in a C++ program. It is a library that helps you take 
advantage of multi-core processor performance without having to be a threading 
expert. Intel TBB is not just a threads-replacement library. 

It represents a higher-level, task-based parallelism that abstracts platform 
details and threading mechanisms for scalability and performance.
