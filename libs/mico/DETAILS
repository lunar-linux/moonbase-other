DESCRIPTION:
GNU-copyright notice. The following design principles guided the
implementation of MICO:

    * start from scratch: only use what standard APIs (Posix/Win32) have to
offer; don't rely on propietary or specialized libraries.
    * use standard C++ for the implementation.
        * only make use of widely available, free, non-proprietary tools.
	    * omit bells and whistles: only implement what is required for a
CORBA compliant implementation.
    * clear design even for implementation internals to ensure extensibility.
