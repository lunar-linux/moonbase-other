cat << EOF
libverto exists to solve an important problem: many applications and libraries are unable to write
asynchronous code because they are unable to pick an event loop. This is particularly true of
libraries who want to be useful to many applications who use loops that do not integrate with one
another or which use home-grown loops. libverto provides a loop-neutral async api which allows the
library to expose asynchronous interfaces and offload the choice of the main loop to the application.
