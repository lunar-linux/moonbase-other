           SHORT="Event expression library inspired by CEE"

cat << EOF
CEE is an upcoming standard used to describe network events in a number of
normalized formats. It's goal is to unify they currently many different
representations that exist in the industry.
The core idea of libee is to provide a small but hopefully convenient API
layer above the CEE standard. However, CEE is not finished. At the time of
this writing, CEE is under heavy development and even some of its core data
structures (like the data dictionary and taxonmy) have not been fully
specified.
