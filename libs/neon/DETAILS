neon is an HTTP and WebDAV client library, with a C interface. Featuring:
  * High-level interface to HTTP and WebDAV methods (PUT, GET, HEAD etc)
  * Low-level interface to HTTP request handling, to allow implementing
    new methods easily.
  * persistent connections
  * RFC2617 basic and digest authentication (including auth-int, md5-sess)
  * Proxy support (including basic/digest authentication)
  * SSL/TLS support using OpenSSL (including client certificate support)
  * Generic WebDAV 207 XML response handling mechanism
  * XML parsing using the expat or libxml parsers
  * Easy generation of error messages from 207 error responses
  * WebDAV resource manipulation: MOVE, COPY, DELETE, MKCOL.
  * WebDAV metadata support: set and remove properties, query any set of
    properties (PROPPATCH/PROPFIND).
  * autoconf macros supplied for easily embedding neon directly inside an
    application source tree.
