cat << EOF
Serd is a lightweight C library for RDF syntax which supports reading and writing Turtle, TRiG, NTriples, and NQuads.

Serd is not intended to be a swiss-army knife of RDF syntax, but rather is suited to resource limited or performance
critical applications (e.g. converting many gigabytes of NTriples to Turtle), or situations where a simple reader/writer
with minimal dependencies is ideal (e.g. in LV2 implementations or embedded applications).
