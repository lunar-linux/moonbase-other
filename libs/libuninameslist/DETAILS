           SHORT="A Library of Unicode names and annotation data"

cat << EOF
In Nameslist.txt the Unicode consortium provides a file containing annotations
on many unicode characters. This library contains a compiled version of this
file so that programs can access this data quickly and easily.
ListeDesNoms.txt is a seperate file which is translated from Nameslist.txt,
These libraries contain very large (sparse) arrays with one entry for each
unicode code point (U+0000â€“U+10FFFF). Each entry contains two strings, a name
and an annotation. Either or both may be NULL. Both libraries also contain a
(much smaller) list of all the Unicode blocks.
