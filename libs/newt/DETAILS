cat << EOF
Newt can be used to add stacked windows, entry widgets, checkboxes, 
radio buttons, labels, plain text fields, scrollbars, etc., to text 
mode user interfaces. This package also contains the shared library 
needed by programs built with newt, as well as a /usr/bin/dialog 
replacement called whiptail. Newt is based on the slang library.
