cat << EOF
Newt can be used to add stacked windows, entry widgets, checkboxes,
radio buttons, labels, plain text fields, scrollbars, etc., to text
mode user interfaces. This package also contains the shared library
needed by programs built with newt, as well as a /usr/bin/dialog
replacement called whiptail. Newt is based on the slang library.
