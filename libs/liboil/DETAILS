Liboil is a library of simple functions that are optimized for various
CPUs. These functions are generally loops implementing simple algorithms,
such as converting an array of N integers to floating-point numbers or
multiplying and summing an array of N numbers. Such functions are
candidates for significant optimization using various techniques,
especially by using extended instructions provided by modern CPUs
(Altivec, MMX, SSE, etc.).
