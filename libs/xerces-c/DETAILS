cat << EOF
Xerces-C++ is a validating XML parser written in a portable subset of
C++. Xerces-C++ makes it easy to give your application the ability to
read and write XML data. A shared library is provided for parsing,
generating, manipulating, and validating XML documents.

Xerces-C++ is faithful to the XML 1.0 recommendation and many
associated standards (see Features below).

The parser provides high performance, modularity, and scalability.
Source code, samples and API documentation are provided with the
parser. For portability, care has been taken to make minimal use
of templates, no RTTI, and minimal use of #ifdefs.
