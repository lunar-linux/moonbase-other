cat << EOF
    jabber.py is a Python module for the jabber instant messaging protocol. jabber.py deals with the xml parsing and socket code, leaving the programmer to concentrate on developing quality jabber based applications with Python.
    The eventual aim is to produce a fully featured easy to use library for creating both jabber clients and servers.
    jabber.py requires at least python 2.0 and the XML expat parser module ( included in the standard Python distrubution ).
    It is developed on Linux but should run happily on over Unix's and win32.
