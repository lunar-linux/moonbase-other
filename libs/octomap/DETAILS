cat << EOF
The OctoMap library implements a 3D occupancy grid mapping approach,
providing data structures and mapping algorithms in C++ particularly
suited for robotics. The map implementation is based on an octree
and is designed to meet the following requirements:
- Full 3D model
- Updatable
- Flexible
- Compact
