cat << EOF
Field3D is an open source library for storing voxel data. It provides C++ classes 
that handle in-memory storage and a file format based on HDF5 that allows the C++ 
objects to be written to and read from disk.

Field3D was developed with the needs and scale of visual effects production in mind. 
Dense and MAC-fields handle the basic tasks in fluid simulation and volume rendering, 
and where memory becomes a limiting factor optimization of used/unused space is provided 
by the sparse fields, which include an out-of-core/dynamic loading mechanism. Procedural 
fields are also supported, which may be used interchangeably with voxel-based fields.
