           SHORT="A library to extract meta-data from arbitrary files"

cat << EOF
libextractor is a library used to extract meta-data from files of
arbitrary type.  It is designed to use helper-libraries to perform the
actual extraction, and to be trivially extendable by linking against
external extractors for additional file types.

The goal is to provide developers of file-sharing networks or
WWW-indexing bots with a universal library to obtain simple keywords to
match against queries.  libextractor contains a shell-command "extract"
that, similar to the well-known "file" command, can extract meta-data
from a file an print the results to stdout.
