cat << EOF
The PCRE library is a set of functions that implement regular expression
pattern matching using the same syntax and semantics as Perl 5, with
just a few differences. PCRE was originally written for the Exim MTA, but 
is now used by many projects including Python, Apache, Postfix, KDE, Analog, 
PHP and Ferite.
