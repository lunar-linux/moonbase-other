cat << EOF
RoadRunner is a complete application toolkit library implementing the 
BEEP (Blocks Extensible Exchange Protocol) for use in developing network
applications.
BEEP is a connection based protocol, where a single BEEP connection can
contain multiple channels in which messages are transmitted. Messages on
different channels are transmitted independently of each other.

Apart from a core BEEP framework, RoadRunner also consists of a useful 
set of profiles, readily available and usable in applications.
