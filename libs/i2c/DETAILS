What is the SMBus? And the I2C bus?
    The SMBus is the "System Management Bus".  More specifically, it 
is a  2-wire, low-speed serial communication bus used for basic health
monitoring and hardware management. It is a specific implementation of
the more general I2C (pronunciation: I-squared-C) bus. In fact, both
I2C devices and SMBus devices may be connected to the same (I2C) bus.
    The SMBus (or I2C bus) starts at the host controller, used for
starting transactions on the SMBus. From the host interface, the
devices communicated with are the 'slave' devices. Each slave device
has a unique 7-bit address in which the host must refer to it with. 
    For each supported SMBus host, there is a separate kernel module
which implements the communication protocol with the host. Some SMBus
hosts really operate on the SMBus level; these hosts can not cope with
pure I2C devices. Other hosts are in fact I2C hosts: in this case, we
implement the SMBus protocol in terms of I2C operations. But these
hosts can also talk to pure I2C devices.
