cat << EOF
UCL is a portable lossless data compression library written in ANSI C.
UCL implements a number of compression algorithms that achieve an excellent
compression ratio while allowing *very* fast decompression. Decompression
requires no additional memory.
UCL is my OpenSource re-implementation of some NRV compression algorithms.
As compared to LZO, the UCL algorithms achieve a better compression ratio but
decompression is a little bit slower. See below for some rough timings.
