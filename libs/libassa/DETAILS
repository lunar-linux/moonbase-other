cat << EOF
libASSA is an object-oriented C++ networking library based on Adaptive
Communication Patterns. It features a simplistic implementation of the
set of communication patterns such as Service Configurator, Reactor,
Acceptor, Connector, and others described in various papers published by
Dr. D. C. Schmidt.

libASSA happily co-exists with other frameworks such as GUI toolkits and
various CORBA implementations.
