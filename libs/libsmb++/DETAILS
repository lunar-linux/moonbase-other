cat << EOF
Libsmb is a C++ library that enables Unix programs to access Windows SMB 
shares. It does so by implementing methods which act the same as the standard 
Unix I/O functions (open, write, readdir...) but on SMB URLs instead. The 
network is completely transparent to the programmer, that is, you can consider 
workgroups, hosts, shares and real paths as directories and files and use them 
as such. For example, "smb:/foogroup" is a directory containing the names of 
the group members and can be opened with opendir("smb:/foogroup"). 

It is a SMB client, which means it can connect to servers and download/upload 
files. It is not a server, and therefore cannot add shares and user accounts 
on the local host.
