Soprano (formerly known as QRDF) is a library which provides a highly
usable object-oriented C++/QT4 framework for RDF data. It uses different
RDF storage solutions as backends through a simple plugin system. Soprano
is targetted at desktop applications that need a RDF data storage solution.
It has been optimized for easy usage and simplicity.
