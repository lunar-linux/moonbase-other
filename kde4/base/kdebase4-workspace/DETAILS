KDE Workspace consisting of what is the desktop. The applications and libraries
included aren't required to be portable and probably will only work with X11. On
other desktops such as OS X and Windows, users wouldn't run these applications, 
but use the native ones instead.  The typical application shouldn't have 
dependencies in workspace unless they are a component such as a screen-saver or 
panel applet.
