KMid is a MIDI/Karaoke player for KDE4. It runs in Linux, using the ALSA 
Sequencer.

KMid plays MIDI and karaoke files to hardware MIDI devices or software 
synthesizers. It supports playlists, MIDI mappers, tempo (speed), volume and 
pitch (transpose) controls and configurable character encoding, font and 
color for lyrics. The graphic views include a rhythm view (visual metronome), 
a channels window with solo/muting controls and instrument selectors, and a 
piano player window (Pianola).
