cat << EOF
RKWard is meant to become an easy to use, transparent frontend to the
R-language, a very powerful, yet hard-to-get-into scripting-language with
a strong focus on statistic functions. It will not only provide a convenient
user-interface, however, but also take care of seamless integration with an
office-suite. Practical statistics is not just about calculating, after all,
but also about documenting and ultimately publishing the results.
