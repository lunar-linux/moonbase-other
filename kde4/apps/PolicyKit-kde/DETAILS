PolicyKit allows easy and secure password management, it can be used by
applications to ask their users for a password. Each application defines a set
of actions that can be executed by their program.

The application will call PolicyKit to see if the user can perform a given
action, if not, the application can issue the auth dialog where the user
can enter his/her password, root password, the password of a given group
of users or even swipe the finger.
