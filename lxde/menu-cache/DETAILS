Libmenu-cache is a library creating and utilizing caches to speed up
the manipulation for freedesktop.org defined application menus.
It can be used as a replacement of libgnome-menu of gnome-menus.
Advantages:
1. Shorten time for loading menu entries.
2. Ease of use. (API is very similar to that of libgnome-menu)
3. Lightweight runtime library. (Parsing of the menu definition files 
   are done by menu-cache-gen when the menus are really changed.)
4. Less unnecessary and complicated file monitoring.
5. Heavily reduced disk I/O.
