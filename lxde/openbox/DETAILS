cat << EOF
Openbox works with your applications, and makes your desktop easier to 
manage. This is because the approach to its development was the opposite 
of what seems to be the general case for window managers. Openbox was 
written first to comply with standards and to work properly. Only when 
that was in place did the team turn to the visual interface.

Openbox is fully functional as a stand-alone working environment, or can 
be used as a drop-in replacement for the default window manager in the 
GNOME or KDE desktop environments.
