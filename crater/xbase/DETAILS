What we have here is not only a C++ class library compatible with older .dbf,
.ndx and .ntx files, and various utilities, but a viable database development
environment for future projects requiring a lightweight database engine.

We define XBase here to mean any dBase, Clipper, FoxPro, etc. compatible
database (including index and memo files). Currently, XBase supports DBF
(dBase and other) database  files, NDX (dbase) and NTX (Clipper) index files,
and DBT (dBase and other) memo field files.  xBase (with a lowercase 'x') means
the xBase library. We hope to add support for other XBase  file formats in the
future.
