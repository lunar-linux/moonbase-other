Uberzug is a command line util which allows to draw images on terminals by using
child windows.
Advantages to w3mimgdisplay:
 - no race conditions as a new window is created to display images
 - expose events will be processed,
 - so images will be redrawn on switch workspaces
 - tmux support (excluding multi pane windows)
 - terminals without the WINDOWID environment variable are supported
 - chars are used as position - and size unit
 - no memory leak (/ unlimited cache)
