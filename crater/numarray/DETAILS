numarray is a rewrite of numerical python and will eventually replace it.
What is Numerical Python?
If x and y are Numerical Python arrays, then the speed of the operation
x + y is close to the speed of doing it in C if the arrays are big
enough. Thus, Python can be extended with a full scientific array
language with sophisticated indexing and shaping operations and yet be
closer to the speed of a compiled language than to the speed of Python
itself.
