cat << EOF
XCache is a open-source opcode cacher, which means that it accelerates
the performance of PHP on servers. It optimizes performance by removing
the compilation time of PHP scripts by caching the compiled state of
PHP scripts into the shm (RAM) and uses the compiled version straight
from the RAM. This will increase the rate of page generation time by
up to 5 times as it also optimizes many other aspects of php scripts
and reduce serverload.
