cat << EOF
SILLY means Simple Image Loading LibrarY. The aim of this library is to
provide a simple library for loading images in the context of CEGUI.
The library supports only the most common image formats. The project was
initially launched in order to provide an MIT-based replacement of DevIL
with less image format supported and focused on loading image only.
