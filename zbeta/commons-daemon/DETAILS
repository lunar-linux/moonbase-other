cat << EOF
Apache commons-daemon provides a portable means of starting and
stopping a Java Virtual Machine (JVM) that is running server-side
applications. Such applications often have additional requirements
compared to client-side applications. For example, the servlet
container Tomcat would need to serialize sessions and shutdown web
applications before the JVM process terminates.

Apache commons-daemon comprises 2 parts: a native library written
in C that interfaces with the operating system, and the library that
provides the Daemon API, written in Java.

There are two ways to use Apache commons-daemon: by implementing the
daemon interface or by calling a class that provides the required
methods for daemon. For example, Tomcat-4.1.x uses the daemon
interface and Tomcat-5.0.x provides a class whose methods are
called by JSVC directly.
