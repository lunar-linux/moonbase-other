cat <<EOF
Script to record how many times system services are being probed,
using configurable pattern matching to recognize failed accesses (such
as for "sshd" or "proftpd" or any service), and when a particular IP
address exceeds a certain number of failed attempts, that IP address
is blocked by using multiple techniques: using /etc/hosts.allow for
services that support TCP_WRAPPERS, or by executing ip route commands
to setup null-routing for that source host address, or by executing
iptables commands to setup packet filtering to drop packets from a
source host address.
