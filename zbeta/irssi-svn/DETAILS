cat << EOF
Irssi is a modular IRC client for UNIX that currently has only text mode
user interface, but 80-90% of the code isn't text mode specific, so other
UIs could be created pretty easily. Also, Irssi isn't really even IRC
specific anymore, there's already working SILC and ICB modules
available. Support for other protocols like ICQ and Jabber could be
created some day too.
