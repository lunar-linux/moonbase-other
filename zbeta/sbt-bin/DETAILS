- accurate recompilation (in theory) is done using information
  extracted by a compiler plugin
- continuous compilation and testing with triggered execution
- supports mixed Scala/Java projects, packages jars, generates
  documentation with scaladoc
- supports testing with ScalaCheck, specs, and ScalaTest
- starts the Scala REPL with project classes and dependencies
  on the classpath
- multiple project/subproject support
- parallel task execution, including parallel test execution
- dependency management support: inline declarations, external
  Ivy or Maven configuration files, or manual management
