 Bugle is a toolkit for debugging and profiling OpenGL applications
running on UNIX-like systems. It consists of two parts: a collection of
filter-sets that observe and sometimes modify calls to the OpenGL API,
and a graphical debugger that helps in examining state, setting break-
points, and capturing errors.

 Bugle is still in active development, and is considered alpha. What
this means is that while there are a lot of features, any given one of
them might be broken on any given day. If you do find a bug, please let
me know (<bmerry@users.sourceforge.net>).
