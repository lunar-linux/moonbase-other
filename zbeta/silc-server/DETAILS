SILC (Secure Internet Live Conferencing) is a protocol which
provides secure conferencing services on the Internet over insecure
channel. SILC superficially resembles IRC, although they are very
different internally. They both provide conferencing services and have
almost the same set of commands. Other than that, they are nothing
alike. The SILC is secure and the network model is entirely different
compared to IRC.

This module provides a fully configurable SILC server.
