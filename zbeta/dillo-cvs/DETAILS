cat << EOF
Dillo is a very fast, extremely small Web browser that's completely
written in C. The source and binary are less than 300 kilobytes each. It
is a graphical browser built upon GTK+, and it renders a good subset of
HTML, excluding frames, JavaScript, and JVM support.

This is the CVS (development) version of dillo.
