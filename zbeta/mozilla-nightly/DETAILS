cat << EOF
This module fetches the latest mozilla from mozilla.org from the nightly
exports, and as such should be available every day. Sometimes these
don't build or don't work, but it can be fun to keep track of mozilla
if you don't mind the fuzz of recompiling mozilla often.

see 'lvu what mozilla' for more info about mozilla
