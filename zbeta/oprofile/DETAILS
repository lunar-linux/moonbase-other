cat << EOF
OProfile is a system-wide profiler for Linux systems, capable of
profiling all running code at low overhead. OProfile is released under
the GNU GPL.
It consists of a kernel driver and a daemon for collecting sample data,
and several post-profiling tools for turning data into information.
OProfile leverages the hardware performance counters of the CPU to
enable profiling of a wide variety of interesting statistics, which can
also be used for basic time-spent profiling. All code is profiled:
hardware and software interrupt handlers, kernel modules, the kernel,
shared libraries, and applications.
OProfile is currently in alpha status; however it has proven stable over
a large number of differing configurations; it is being used on machines
ranging from laptops to 16-way NUMA-Q boxes. As always, there is no
warranty.
Unobtrusive
  No special recompilations, wrapper libraries or the like are necessary.
  Even debug symbols (-g option to gcc) are not necessary unless you want
  to produce annotated source.
    No kernel patch is needed - just insert the module.
    System-wide profiling
            All code running on the system is profiled, enabling analysis
            of system performance.
    Performance counter support
            Enables collection of various low-level data, and assocation
            with particular sections of code.
    Low overhead
            OProfile has a typical overhead of 1-8%, dependent on sampling
            frequency and workload.
    Post-profile analysis
            Profile data can be produced on the function-level or
            instruction-level detail. Source trees annotated with profile
            information can be created. A hit list of applications and
            functions that take the most time across the whole system can
            be produced.
    System support
            OProfile works across a range of CPUs, include the Intel range,
            AMD's Athlon and Hammer range, the Alpha, and more. OProfile
            will work against almost any 2.2, 2.4 and 2.5 kernels, and works
            on both UP and SMP systems from desktops to the scariest NUMAQ
            boxes.
