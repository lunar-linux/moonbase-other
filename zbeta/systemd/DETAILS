cat << EOF
systemd is a system and session manager for Linux, compatible with SysV 
and LSB init scripts. systemd provides aggressive parallelization 
capabilities, uses socket and D-Bus activation for starting services, 
offers on-demand starting of daemons, keeps track of processes using 
Linux cgroups, supports snapshotting and restoring of the system state, 
maintains mount and automount points and implements an elaborate 
transactional dependency-based service control logic. 
It can work as a drop-in replacement for sysvinit.
