cat << EOF
Chromium is an open-source browser project that aims to build a safer, faster,
and more stable way for all users to experience the web.

These are snapshot, build-bot, pre-compiled binaries of chrome for Linux.
Snapshots are supposedly "mostly working" and are chosen by the Lunar Devs with
care.  32bit linux, green in "release full and linux" columns. 64bit linux, same
plus "memory" column.
