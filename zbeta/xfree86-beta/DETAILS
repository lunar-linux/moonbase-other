cat << EOF
The XFree86 Project, Inc is an organisation which produces XFree86, a freely 
redistributable open-source implementation of the X Window System that runs on 
UNIX(R) and UNIX-like (like Linux, the BSDs, Mac OS X (aka Darwin) and Solaris 
x86 series) operating systems and OS/2.
XFree86 is the underlying software that is between the hardware and graphical 
user interface (aka gui) that people see and use. If you are using KDE, GNOME, 
Enlightenment, Blackbox, AfterStep, twm or fvwm then you are already using and 
running XFree86 as these run as our clients.
Traditionally, The XFree86 Project has focused on Intel x86-based platforms, 
which is where the 86 in our name comes from, but our current release supports 
other platforms like the Alpha, PowerPC, Sparc and in-the-works MIPS CPU 
families.
Our goal at XFree86 is to have X run on every platform available, including 
those we do not currently support, as the best windowing system available on 
that platform.

This is a developement snapshot for testing purposes. It can be compiled under 
linux-test kernels, with kernel-headers for that kernels too.
