cat << EOF
Descent I is a 3D first-person shooter video game, noted for
popularizing the use of true 3D rendering technology and providing the
player with six full degrees of freedom (often abbreviated "6DOF") to
move and to look around.

To play this game, you'll need some data files installed in
/usr/share/games/d1x-rebirth - see INSTALL.txt, or install
descent1-demodata.
