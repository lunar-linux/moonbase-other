cat <<EOF
This is a media center designed mostly for use on a television hooked up to
your pc via a remote control. see the key controls at the end to make your
remote send the right keystrokes - eventually this will be 100% configurable
via the gui.
	
This is a WORK IN PROGRESS - it is NOT COMPLETE. do not expect everything to
work and do what you want.
