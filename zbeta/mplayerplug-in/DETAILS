mplayerplug-in is a browser plugin that uses mplayer to play
digital media from websites.
This plug-in gives Firefox/Seamonkey the ability to play media from a
website the net without reading the source html and getting
the url manually. Media is played embedded in the page or in
a separate window depending on how the author of the webpage
intended the media to be seen.
