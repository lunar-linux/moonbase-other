cat << EOF
Node.js is an event-driven I/O framework for the V8 JavaScript engine on
Unix-like platforms. It is intended for writing scalable network programs
such as web servers. Node.js is similar in purpose to Twisted for Python,
Perl Object Environment for Perl, and EventMachine for Ruby. Unlike most
JavaScript, it is not executed in a web browser, but it is rather related
to server-side JavaScript. Node.js implements some CommonJS specifications
and includes a REPL environment for interactive testing.
