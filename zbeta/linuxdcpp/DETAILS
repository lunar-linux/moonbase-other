LinuxDC++ is a Linux port of the Direct Connect client DC++. Though
it is primarily aimed at Linux, it has been shown to work on other
Unix-based operating systems as well. It is written in C++ and makes
use of GTK+ for the user-interface.

LinuxDC++ is free and open source software licensed under the GPL.
Direct connect is a peer-to-peer file-sharing protocol. The most popular
Windows client implementing this protocol currently is DC++. Direct
connect clients connect to a central hub where they can view a list of
clients or users connected to them. Users can search for files and download
them from other clients, as well as chat with other users.
