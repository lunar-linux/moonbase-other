This is the developmental version of mutt with the sidebar patch.
Mutt is a small but very powerful text-based MIME mail client. It is
highly configurable, and is well-suited to the mail power user with
advanced features like key bindings, keyboard macros, mail threading,
regular expression searches, and a powerful pattern matching language
for selecting groups of messages.
NOTE: the sidebar patch is now maintained by tchan as of 20060720.
