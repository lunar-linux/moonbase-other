cat << EOF
xf86-video-voodoo provides the X.Org video driver for the 3dfx Voodoo1
Voodoo2 series of video cards.

On the Voodoo1 the driver uses a shadow buffer in system memory as the
video adapter has only 3D acceleration.   Selected portions of the shadow
framebuffer are copied out to the Voodoo board at the right time.  Because
of this, the speed of the driver is very dependent on the CPU.  Processors
nowdays are actually rather fast at moving data so we get very good speed
anyway as the shadow framebuffer is in cached RAM. 

The Voodoo2 has 16bpp acceleration and the driver provides accelerated
versions of most operations except angled lines and stipples.  Accelerated
alpha blending with the Render extension is also supported as is DGA.
