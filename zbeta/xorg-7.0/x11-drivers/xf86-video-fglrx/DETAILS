cat << EOF
Proprietary X.Org driver for the ATI 8500 and 9x00 series. Contains
binary kernel module (fglrx.o) and ATI's X11 tools, includes and GLX
header files. This driver will provide 3D acceleration for most
7xxx and 9xxx cards, including the 'radeon' cards.

An alternative GPL driver is in the XOrg-drm module, but that one
does not support all FireGL cards.
