Xrefresh is a simple X program that causes all or part of your screen to be
repainted. This is useful when system messages have messed up your screen. 
Xrefresh maps a window on top of the desired area of the screen and then 
immediately unmaps it, causing refresh events to be sent to all applications. 

By default, a window with no background is used, causing all applications to
repaint ``smoothly.'' However, the various options can be used to indicate that
a solid background (of any color) or the root window background should be
used instead.
