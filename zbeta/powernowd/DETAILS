cat << EOF
This is a simple client to the CPUFreq driver that uses
Linux kernel v2.5/v2.6 sysfs interface.  You need a supported CPU
and a kernel that supports sysfs to run this daemon.
this will work with any CPUfreq capable processor,
not just processors supporting AMD's PowerNow! technology.
However, it is designed to work better on processors that support
more then 2 frequency steps like those with AMD's PowerNow! or the
new Pentium M processors.
