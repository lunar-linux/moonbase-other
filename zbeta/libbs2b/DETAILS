Typical stereo recordings are being made to listen to by speakers. This
means that a sound engineer makes the stereo mix to the adaptation of
sound for listening to one channel by both ears. Therefore, you will be
tired during long-time headphone listening, more because of superstereo
effect than because of poorly-designed headphones. What's missing in
headphones is the sound going from each channel to the opposite ear,
arriving a short time later for the extra distance travelled, and with a
bit of high-frequency roll-off for the shadowing effect of the head. And
the time delay to the far ear is somewhat longer at low frequencies than
at high frequencies. The Bauer stereophonic-to-binaural DSP (bs2b) is
designed to improve headphone listening of stereo audio records.
