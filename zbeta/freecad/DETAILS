cat << EOF
FreeCAD is a general purpose Open Source 3D CAD/MCAD/CAx/CAE/PLM modeler, aimed
directly at mechanical engineering and product design but also fits a wider 
range of uses in engineering, such as architecture or other engineering 
specialties. It is a feature-based parametric modeler with a modular software 
architecture which makes it easy to provide additional functionality without 
modifying the core system.

FreeCAD is based on OpenCasCade, a powerful geometry kernel, features an Open 
Inventor-compliant 3D scene representation model provided by the Coin 3D 
library, and a broad Python API. The interface is built with Qt.
