cat << EOF
MP3 Diags is a GUI-based application that allows end-users to identify
issues with their MP3 files, fix some of the issues and make other
changes, like adding track information. It also lets you "look inside"
an MP3 file.

Unlike some programs that are designed to deal with a single topic
(like fixing VBR headers or adding cover art), MP3 Diags is a one-stop
solution that identifies more than 50 different issues in MP3 files,
and provides the means to fix many of them.
