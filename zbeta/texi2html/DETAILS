           SHORT="A Perl script which converts Texinfo files to HTML output"

cat << EOF
This is an evolving version of the script, and now supports many
advanced features, such as internationalization and extremely
configurable output formats. It is still in development despite the
fact that GNU makeinfo now supports HTML output, because it still
supports many features beyond those supported by makeinfo.
