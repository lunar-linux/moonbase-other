Zsh is a UNIX command interpreter (shell) which of the standard shells
most resembles the Korn shell (ksh). It includes enhancements of many
types, notably in the command-line editor, options for customising
its behaviour, filename globbing, features to make C-shell (csh)
users feel more at home and extra features drawn from tcsh.
