cat << EOF
EDuke32 is an awesome, free homebrew game engine and source port of the
classic PC first person shooter Duke Nukem 3D (Duke3D for short) to
Windows, Linux, Mac OS X, FreeBSD, several handhelds, and to your
family toaster. We've added all kinds of new renderers, tons of cool
features and upgrades for regular players, and thousands of additional
editing capabilities and scripting extensions for mod creators.

Copy Duke3dw.GRP into ~/.eduke32/

Optionally install & unzip the High Resolution Pack, so have e.g.:
~/.eduke32/autoload/duke3d.grp/highres/textures/5090.jpg
