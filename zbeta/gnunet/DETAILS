GNUnet is a framework for secure peer-to-peer networking that does
not use any centralized or otherwise trusted services. A first
service implemented on top of the networking layer allows anonymous
censorship-resistant file-sharing. Anonymity is provided by making
messages originating from a peer indistinguishable from messages
that the peer is routing. All peers act as routers and use
link-encrypted connections with stable bandwidth utilization to
communicate with each other. GNUnet uses a simple, excess-based
economic model to allocate resources. Peers in GNUnet monitor each
others behavior with respect to resource usage; peers that
contribute to the network are rewarded with better service.
GNUnet is part of the GNU project.
