tcpserver and tcpclient are easy-to-use command-line tools for
building TCP client-server applications.

tcpserver waits for incoming connections and, for each connection,
runs a program of your choice. Your program receives environment
variables showing the local and remote host names, IP addresses, and
port numbers.

tcpserver offers a concurrency limit to protect you from running out
of processes and memory. When you are handling 40 (by default)
simultaneous connections, tcpserver smoothly defers acceptance of new
connections.

tcpserver also provides TCP access control features, similar to
tcp-wrappers/tcpd's hosts.allow but much faster. Its access control
rules are compiled into a hashed format with cdb, so it can easily
deal with thousands of different hosts.

This package includes a recordio tool that monitors all the input and
output of a server.

tcpclient makes a TCP connection and runs a program of your choice.
It sets up the same environment variables as tcpserver.

This package includes several sample clients built on top of
tcpclient: who@, date@, finger@, http@, tcpcat, and mconnect.

tcpserver and tcpclient conform to UCSPI, the UNIX Client-Server
Program Interface, using the TCP protocol. UCSPI tools are available
for several different networks.
