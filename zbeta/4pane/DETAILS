cat <<EOF
4Pane is a multi-pane, detailed-list file manager for Linux. It is
designed to be fully-featured without bloat, and aims for speed rather
than visual effects. In addition to standard file manager things,
it offers multiple undo and redo of most operations (including
deletions), archive management including 'virtual browsing' inside
archives, multiple renaming/duplication of files, a terminal emulator
and user-defined tools.
