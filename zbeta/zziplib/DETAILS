cat << EOF
The zziplib library offers the ability to easily extract
data from files archived in a single zip file. Applications
can bundle files into a single zip archive and access them.
The implementation is based only on the (free) subset of
compression with the zlib algorithm which is actually used
by the zip/unzip tools.
