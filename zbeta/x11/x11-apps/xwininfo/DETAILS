Xwininfo is a utility for displaying information about windows. Various
information is displayed depending on which options are selected. If no
options are chosen, -stats is assumed. 

 The user has the option of selecting the target window with the mouse
 (by clicking any mouse button in the desired window) or by specifying its
 window id on the command line with the -id option. Or instead of specifying
 the window by its id number, the -name option may be used to specify which
 window is desired by name. There is also a special -root option to quickly
 obtain information on the screen's root window.
