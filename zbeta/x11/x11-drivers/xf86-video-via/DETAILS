cat << EOF
The via driver supports the VIA CLE266, KM400/KN400 chipsets, including 2D 
acceleration and the Xv video overlay extensions. Flat panel, TV and VGA 
outputs are supported. 

K8M800/K8N800, PM8X0 and CN400 support is still under development. 

Direct rendering 3D is available using experimental drivers in Mesa. Also there
is an XvMC client library for hardware MPEG1 / MPEG2 decoding acceleration 
available on the CLE266 and K8M/N800 chipsets that uses the DRI. The XvMC 
client library implements a nonstandard '34'VLD'34' extension to the XvMC 
standard. The current Direct Rendering Manager Linux kernel module is 
available at dri.sourceforge.net.
