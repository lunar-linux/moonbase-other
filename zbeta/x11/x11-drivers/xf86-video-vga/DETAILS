cat << EOF
vga  is an __xservername__ driver for generic VGA video cards. It can drive
most VGA-compatible video cards, but only makes use of the basic standard
VGA core that is common to these cards. The driver supports depths 1, 4 
and 8. All relevant visual types are supported at each depth. Multi-head
configurations are supported in combination with some other drivers, but
only when the vga driver is driving the primary head.
