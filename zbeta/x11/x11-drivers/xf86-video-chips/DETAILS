cat << EOF
The majority of the Chips and Technologies chipsets are supported by this 
driver. In general the limitation on the capabilities of this driver are 
determined by the chipset on which it is run. Where possible, this driver 
provides full acceleration and supports the following depths: 1, 4, 8, 15, 
16, 24 and on the latest chipsets an 8+16 overlay mode. All visual types 
are supported for depth 1, 4 and 8 and both TrueColor and DirectColor 
visuals are supported where possible. Multi-head configurations are 
supported on PCI or AGP buses.
