cat << EOF
voodoo  is an XFree86 driver for Voodoo 1 and Voodoo 2 series video adapters. 
On the Voodoo 1 the driver uses a shadow buffer in system memory as the video
adapter has only 3D acceleration. Selected portions of the shadow framebuffer 
are copied out to the Voodoo board at the right time. Because of this, the 
speed of the driver is very dependent on the CPU. Processors nowdays are 
actually rather fast at moving data so we get very good speed anyway as the 
shadow framebuffer is in cached RAM. 

The Voodoo2 has 16bpp acceleration and the driver provides accelerated versions
of most operations except angled lines and stipples. Accelerated alpha blending
with the Render extension is also supported as is DGA.
