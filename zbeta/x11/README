X11R7 for Lunar Linux

-------------------------------------------------------------------
| ATTENTION: THIS DOES NOT WORK! YOU _WILL_ BREAK YOUR X11 INCASE |
| YOU TRY TO INSTALL IT!					  |

You have been warned.

We are missing checksums, descriptions and some other vital information
to install this new release.

We will definitely need this line of sed code:

cp -v /usr/include/linux/agpgart.h /usr/include/linux/agpgart.h.orig

sed -e 's|__u16|unsigned short|g' -e 's|__u32|unsigned|g' \
-i /usr/include/linux/agpgart.h

25/01/06: started with the fonts... few remarks: install bdftopcf,mkfontdir,mkfontscale manually (not added in DEPENDS yet) and symlink /usr/X11R7 to /usr/X11 manually (not added in a BUILD file yet)

24/01/06: started our first ever x11r7 server on lunar linux!!! Without any-
thing .. even without xterm or wm .. but it starts (autodetected config).

23/01/06: we managed to compile the first xorg-server off samuel's modules. way
to go .. but still, a leap forward.

20/01/06: basically what i'm trying to do is to install xorg-server (which
is included already) and adjust that DEPENDS file of it and making the
modules while i'm going along... (just in case someone wants to help as
i'll be off for the weekend).
