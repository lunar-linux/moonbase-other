We will definitely need this line of sed code:

cp -v /usr/include/linux/agpgart.h /usr/include/linux/agpgart.h.orig

sed -e 's|__u16|unsigned short|g' -e 's|__u32|unsigned|g' \
-i /usr/include/linux/agpgart.h

23/01/06: we managed to compile the first xorg-server off samuel's modules. way
to go .. but still, a leap forward.

20/01/06: basically what i'm trying to do is to install xorg-server (which
is included already) and adjust that DEPENDS file of it and making the
modules while i'm going along... (just in case someone wants to help as
i'll be off for the weekend).
