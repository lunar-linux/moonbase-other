please do not try to install this... 
no checksumming, no description... it's even just uninstallable...

20/01/05 basically what i'm trying to do is to install xorg-server (which is included already) and adjust that DEPENDS file of it and making the modules while i'm going along... (just in case someone wants to help as i'll be off for the weekend)
