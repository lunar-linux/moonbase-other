-------------------------------------------------------------------
| ATTENTION: THIS DOES NOT WORK! YOU _WILL_ BREAK YOUR X11 INCASE |

You have been warned.

We are missing checksums, descriptions and some other vital information
to install this new release.

We will definitely need this line of sed code:

cp -v /usr/include/linux/agpgart.h /usr/include/linux/agpgart.h.orig

sed -e 's|__u16|unsigned short|g' -e 's|__u32|unsigned|g' \
-i /usr/include/linux/agpgart.h

30/01/06 we definately need a symlink from /usr/include/X11 to /usr/X11R7/include/X11 ... gtk+-2 depends on it... seems like they have a bug in the configure script...

25/01/06: started with the fonts... few remarks: install bdftopcf,mkfontdir,mkfontscale manually (not added in DEPENDS yet), symlink /usr/X11R7 to /usr/X11 manually (not added in a BUILD file yet) and add /usr/X11R7/lib in the /etc/ld.so.conf file

24/01/06: started our first ever x11r7 server on lunar linux!!! Without any-
thing .. even without xterm or wm .. but it starts (autodetected config).

23/01/06: we managed to compile the first xorg-server off samuel's modules. way
to go .. but still, a leap forward.

20/01/06: basically what i'm trying to do is to install xorg-server (which
is included already) and adjust that DEPENDS file of it and making the
modules while i'm going along... (just in case someone wants to help as
i'll be off for the weekend).
