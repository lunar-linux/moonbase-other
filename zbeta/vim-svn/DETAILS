VIM is an improved version of the editor vi, one of the standard text
editors on UNIX systems.
VIM adds many of the features that you would expect in an editor:
Unlimited undo, syntax coloring, split windows, visual selection,
graphical user interface (read: menus, mouse control, scrollbars, text
selection), and much much more.
