Typical stereo recordings are being made to listen to by speakers. This
means that a sound engineer makes the stereo mix to the adaptation of
sound for listening to one channel by both ears. Therefore, you will be
tired during long-time headphone listening, more because of superstereo
effect than because of poorly-designed headphones. What's missing in
headphones is the sound going from each channel to the opposite ear,
arriving a short time later for the extra distance travelled, and with a
bit of high-frequency roll-off for the shadowing effect of the head. And
the time delay to the far ear is somewhat longer at low frequencies than
at high frequencies. The Bauer stereophonic-to-binaural DSP (bs2b) is
designed to improve headphone listening of stereo audio records.

Sample ~/.asoundrc:

pcm.headphones {
  type plug
  slave.pcm {
    type ladspa
    slave.pcm "default"
    path "/usr/lib/ladspa"
    plugins {
      0 {
        id 4221  # Bauer stereophonic-to-binaural (4221/bs2b)
        input {
          controls [ 725 4.5 ]
        }
      }
    }
  }
