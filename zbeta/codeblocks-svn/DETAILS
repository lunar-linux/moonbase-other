The open source, cross platform Free C++ IDE.

Code::Blocks is a free C++ IDE built specifically to meet the most
demanding needs of its users. It was designed, right from the
start, to be extensible and configurable.

Built around a plugin framework, Code::Blocks can be extended with
plugins. It includes a plugin wizard so you can create your own
plugins!
