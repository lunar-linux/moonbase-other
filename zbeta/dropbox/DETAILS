Put your files into your Dropbox folder on one computer, and they'll
automatically appear on any of your other computers that also have
Dropbox installed (Windows, Mac, and Linux too!). You can even download
Dropbox apps for your smartphone or mobile device (iPhone, iPad,
Android, and Blackberry). Everything in your Dropbox is available from
the Dropbox website, too.
