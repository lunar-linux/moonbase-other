cat << EOF
Trie is a kind of digital search tree, an efficient indexing method
with O(1) time complexity for searching. Comparably as efficient as
hashing, trie also provides flexibility on incremental matching and
key spelling manipulation. This makes it ideal for lexical analyzers,
as well as spelling dictionaries.

This library is an implementation of double-array structure for
representing trie.
