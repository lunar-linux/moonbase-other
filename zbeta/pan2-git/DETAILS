cat << EOF
Pan is a newsreader, loosely based on Agent and Gravity, which attempts
to be pleasant to use for new and advanced users alike. It has all the
typical features found in newsreaders, and also supports offline
reading, multiple connections, and a number of features for power users
and alt.binaries fans.

pan2-beta is a complete rewrite of pan2 in C++. Smaller memory foot print for
large newsgroups has been cut by 2/3. Time to download headers has been cut
by 2/3 by parallelizing the download across multiple connections to the server.
Multiserver support. NZB support. All the user interface windows and dialogs
have been redesigned.

pan2-git is pan2-beta with many "fixes" that seem to be on hold as the regular
pan2 projects seems to be stalled for over a year now. This is currently the
ONLY version in moonbase that correctly compiles with gmime-2.4.x, newer glib-2,
etc.
