cat << EOF
ntop is a network traffic probe that shows the network usage, similar 
to what the popular top Unix command does. ntop is based on libpcap 
and it has been written in a portable way in order to virtually run on 
every Unix platform and on Win32 as well. 
ntop users can use a a web browser (e.g. netscape) to navigate through 
ntop (that acts as a web server) traffic information and get a dump of 
the network status. In the latter case, ntop can be seen as a simple 
RMON-like agent with an embedded web interface.
