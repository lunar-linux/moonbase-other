smem is a tool that can give numerous reports on memory usage on Linux
systems. Unlike existing tools, smem can report proportional set size
(PSS), which is a more meaningful representation of the amount of
memory used by libraries and applications in a virtual memory system.
Because large portions of physical memory are typically shared among
multiple applications, the standard measure of memory usage known
as resident set size (RSS) will significantly overestimate memory
usage. PSS instead measures each application's "fair share" of each
shared area to give a realistic measure.
