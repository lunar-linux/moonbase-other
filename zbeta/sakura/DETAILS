cat <<EOF
sakura is a terminal emulator based on GTK and VTE. It's a terminal
emulator with few dependencies, so you don't need a full GNOME
desktop installed to have a decent terminal emulator. Current terminal
emulators based on VTE are gnome-terminal, XFCE Terminal, TermIt and
a small sample program included in the vte sources. The differences
between sakura and the last one are that it uses a notebook to provide
several terminals in one window and adds a contextual menu with some
basic options. No more no less.
