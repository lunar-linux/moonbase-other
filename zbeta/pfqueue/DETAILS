cat << EOF
pfqueue is an effort to give postqueue/mailq/postsuper/exim4 a
console (ncurses) interface: it won't add any particular
functionality to those provided with MTAs themselves, but will
hopefully make them easier to use.

It's a real-time queue scanner, that shows per-queue lists of
existing messages; the messages can be shown, deleted, put on
hold, released or requeued

Just for example, it may be useful to inspect a traffic jam at
a given time, to see what is falling into and unexpectedly
crowding your deferred queue.
