The SWORD Project is the CrossWire Bible Society's free Bible software
project. Its purpose is to create cross-platform open-source tools--
covered by the GNU General Public License-- that allow programmers and
Bible societies to write new Bible software more quickly and easily. We
also create Bible study software for all readers, students, scholars,
and translators of the Bible, and have a growing collection of over
200 texts in over 50 languages.
