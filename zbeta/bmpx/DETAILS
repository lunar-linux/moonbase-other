cat << EOF
BMPx is a media player based on the experimental branch/codebase of
the (now dead) BMP project.  This experimental codebase will eventually
lead to the release of BMP 2.0.

In general, users of BMP should be familiar with BMPx right from the
beginning, but there will be new features and usage semantics changes
as well.  The code has been rewritten ~95% from scratch, including the
skinning engine and the playback backend.

Features
 - Support for multiple playlists
 - GUI-less player
 - Deamonized running and DBus control
 - Metadata cache
