BMPx is the codename for the next-generation BMP.  In general, users of
BMP should be familiar with BMPx right from the beginning, but there will
be new features and usage semantics changes as well.  The code has been
rewritten ~95% from scratch, including the skinning engine and the 
playback backend.

Features
 - Support for multiple playlists
 - GUI-less player
 - Deamonized running and DBus control
 - Metadata cache
