Bos Wars is a futuristic real-time strategy game (RTS). In a RTS game,
the player has to combat his enemies while developing his war economy.
Everything runs in real-time, as opposed to turn-based games where the
player always has to wait for his turn. The trick is to balance the
effort put into building his economy and building an army to defend and
attack the enemies.

Bos Wars has a dynamic rate-based economy. Energy is produced by power
plants, and magma gets pumped from hot spots. Buildings and mobile
units are also built at a continuous rate. Control of larger parts of
the map creates the potential to increase your economy throughput.
Holding key points like roads and passages allow for different
strategies.

It is possible to play against human opponents over LAN, Internet, or
against the computer. Bos Wars successfully runs under Linux, MS
Windows, BSD, and Mac OS X.
