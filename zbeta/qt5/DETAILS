cat << EOF
Qt is a C++ toolkit for application development. It lets application
developers target all major operating systems with a single application
source code.

Qt provides a platform-independent API to all central platform
functionality: GUI, database access, networking, file handling, etc. The
Qt library encapsulates the different APIs of different operating systems,
providing the application programmer with a single, common API for all
operating systems. The native C APIs are encapsulated in a set of
well-designed, fully object-oriented C++ classes.
