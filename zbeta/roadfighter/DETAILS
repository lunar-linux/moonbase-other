cat << EOF
In 2003, the people from Retro Remakes organized a remake competition
for the first time. The idea was to create a remake from scratch in a
short amount of time. We decided to participate with a remake of the
MSX game Road Fighter: a simple racing game that would be doable before
the deadline and still be fun to play (oh the nostalgia!).

In the end we met the deadline (barely!) and sent in our entry. When
finally the results came in, we finished 7th out of the 83 entries. Not
too bad for a 2-month project :)
