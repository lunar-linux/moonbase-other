Tor is a network of virtual tunnels that allows people and groups
to improve their privacy and security on the Internet. It also
enables software developers to create new communication tools
with built-in privacy features. Tor provides the foundation for
a range of applications that allow organizations and individuals
to share information over public networks without compromising
their privacy.
