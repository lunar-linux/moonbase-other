Tor is a network of virtual tunnels that allows people and groups to improve
their privacy and security on the Internet. It also enables software
developers to create new communication tools with built-in privacy features.
Tor provides the foundation for a range of applications that allow
organizations and individuals to share information over public networks
without compromising their privacy.
