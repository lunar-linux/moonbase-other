Elicit is a tool for examining images on your desktop, providing both
a global color picker and a zoom tool.  Graphic artists and designers
can quickly examine graphics without needed to rely on larger tools
such as GIMP for simple examinations and color checks.  Elicit is
especially useful for theme development and spot checking.
