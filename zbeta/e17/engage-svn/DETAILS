Engage is an application that takes a new approach to handling your
iconbars, icon boxes and panels.  All you need to know about your 
applications is now in one convenient location.  It can launch 
applications, notify if applications are running, contain the icons of
iconified windows and maintain a "system tray" for applications 
supporting the standard.  Another feature is that it can embed other 
"edje" files.
