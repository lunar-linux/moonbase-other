Elementary is a widget set. It is a new-style of widget set much more canvas
object based than anything else. Why not ETK? Why not EWL? Well they both tend
to veer away from the core of Evas, Ecore and Edje a lot to build their own
worlds. Also I wanted something focused on embedded devices - specifically
small touchscreens. Unlike GTK+ and Qt, 75% of the "widget set" is already
embodied in a common core - Ecore, Edje, Evas etc. So this fine-grained library
splitting means all of this is shared, just a new widget "personality" is on
top. And that is... Elementary, my dear watson. Elementary.
