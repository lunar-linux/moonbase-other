Scribus is a Layout program for Linux®, similar to Adobe® PageMaker,
QuarkXPress or Adobe® InDesign, except that it is published under the 
GNU GPL. Scribus has the ability to layout newsletters, create corporate 
stationery, small posters and other documents which need flexible layout 
and/or the ability to output to professional quality imagesetting 
equipment. You can do all the typical tasks like placing and rotating text 
and/or images on a page, specify manual kerning of type and much more.
NOTE: this is the "stable" DEVELOPMENTAL version of scribus!
