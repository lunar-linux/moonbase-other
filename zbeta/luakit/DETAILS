cat << EOF
luakit is a highly configurable, micro-browser framework based on
the WebKit web content engine and the GTK+ toolkit. It is very fast,
extensible by Lua and licensed under the GNU GPLv3 license.  It is
primarily targeted at power users, developers and any people with
too much time on their hands who want to have fine-grained control
over their web browsers behaviour and interface.
