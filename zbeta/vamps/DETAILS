Vamps builds a wrapper around the requantizer to extract the elementary
MPEG2 video stream from the DVD's program stream, feed it through the
requantizer and finally re-pack it into the program stream again.

Summed up, Vamps is only a very basic, but nevertheless essential tool
to transcode DVD videos to a smaller size. Vamps does not need to write
temporary data files, which is a major pro. Vamps is very fast. The
downside is, that Vamps is not capable to make DVD backups on its own.
