Turck MMCache is a free open source PHP accelerator, optimizer, encoder and
dynamic content cache for PHP. It increases performance of PHP scripts by
caching them in compiled state, so that the overhead of compiling is almost
completely eliminated. Also it uses some optimizations to speed up execution
of PHP scripts. Turck MMCache typically reduces server load and increases the
speed of your PHP code by 1-10 times.
