Certain environment variables must be defined before compiling and using qt 
and applications that depend on qt, QT_PREFIX and/or QTDIR. 
The default values are:
   QT_PREFIX= 
   QTDIR=/opt/lunar/qt. 
You can put the file actual.rc in the /etc/profile.d directory containing the 
new value of QT_PREFIX, and it's value will be used as the location where the 
qt module to be installed. QTDIR value is used as a default value unless a 
new value is set for QT_PREFIX. Remember to logout and login again after you
put/alter the actual.rc file, in order to be processed, and after that to 
begin the qt install process.
