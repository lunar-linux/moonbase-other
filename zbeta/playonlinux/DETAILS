PlayOnLinux is a piece of sofware which allows you to easily install
and use numerous games and software designed to run with Microsoft's
Windows.
Few games are compatible with GNU/Linux at the moment, and it certainly
is a factor preventing the migration to this system. PlayOnLinux brings
an accessible and efficient solution to this problem, cost-free and
respectful of the free software.
