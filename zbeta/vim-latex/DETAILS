cat << EOF
Vim is undoubtedly one of the best editors ever made. LaTeX is an
extremely powerful, intelligent typesetter. Vim-LaTeX aims at bringing
together the best of both of these worlds.

We attempt to provide a comprehensive set of tools to view, edit and
compile LaTeX documents without ever needing to quit Vim. Together,
they provide tools starting from macros to speed up editing LaTeX
documents, to compiling TeX files, to forward-searching .dvi documents.

To activate this vim plugin, see:
