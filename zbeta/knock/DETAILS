cat <<EOF
knockd is a port-knock server. It listens to all traffic on an
ethernet (or PPP) interface, looking for special "knock" sequences of
port-hits. A client makes these port-hits by sending a TCP (or UDP)
packet to a port on the server. This port need not be open -- since
knockd listens at the link-layer level, it sees all traffic even if
it's destined for a closed port. When the server detects a specific
sequence of port-hits, it runs a command defined in its configuration
file. This can be used to open up holes in a firewall for quick access.
