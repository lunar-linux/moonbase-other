Meld is a visual diff and merge tool.  It integrates especially well 
with CVS.  The diff viewer lets you edit files in place (diffs update 
dynamically), and a middle column shows detailed changes and allows 
merges.  The margins show location of changes for easy navigation, and 
it also features a tabbed interface that allows you to open many diffs 
at once.
