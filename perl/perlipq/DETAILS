cat << EOF
  Perlipq is a Perl extension to Linux iptables userspace queueing via libipq.

  Packets may be selected from the stack via the iptables QUEUE target
  and passed to userspace.  Perlipq allows these packets to be manipulated in
  Perl and passed back to the stack.

  This is version 1.25, released against iptables 1.2.5 with support for
  IPv6.
