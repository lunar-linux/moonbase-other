DBD::mysql:

This is the perl5 Database Interface driver for the MySQL database.
In other words: DBD::mysql is an interface between the Perl programming
language and the MySQL programming API that comes with the MySQL relational
database management system.  Most functions provided by the MySQL programming
API are supported in DBD::mysql.  Some rarely used functions are missing,
mainly because no one ever requested them.
