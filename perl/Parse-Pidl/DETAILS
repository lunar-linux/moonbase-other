cat << EOF
Pidl works by building a parse tree from a .pidl file (a simple
dump of it's internal parse tree) or a .idl file
(a file format mostly like the IDL file format midl uses).
The IDL file parser is in idl.yp (a yacc file converted to
perl code by yapp)

After a parse tree is present, pidl will call one of it's backends
(which one depends on the options given on the command-line).
