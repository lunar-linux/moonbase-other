cat << EOF
Path::Class is a module for manipulation of file and directory
specifications (strings describing their locations, like
'/home/ken/foo.txt' or 'C:\Windows\Foo.txt') in a cross-platform manner.
It supports pretty much every platform Perl runs on, including Unix,
Windows, Mac, VMS, Epoc, Cygwin, OS/2, and NetWare.
