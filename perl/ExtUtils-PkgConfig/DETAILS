	   SHORT="simplistic interface to pkg-config"
cat << EOF
The pkg-config program retrieves information about installed libraries,
usually for the purposes of compiling against and linking to them.

ExtUtils::PkgConfig is a very simplistic interface to this utility,
intended for use in the Makefile.PL of perl extensions which bind
libraries that pkg-config knows. It is really just boilerplate code that
you would've written yourself.
