Mail::Sendmail : A simple module to send mail.

Simple platform independent e-mail from your perl script.
Only requires Perl 5 and a network connection.

After struggling for some time with various command-line mailing
programs which never did exactly what I wanted, I put together
this Perl only solution.

Mail::Sendmail contains mainly &sendmail, which takes a hash with the
message to send and sends it. It is intended to be very easy to setup
and use.
