           SHORT="Perl bindings to the Clutter OpenGL canvas"

cat << EOF
Perl bindings to the Clutter OpenGL canvas.  Clutter aims to give a nice
and easy GObject based API for creating fast, heavily stylised applications,
such as media box UI, presentations, kiosk style applications, etc.

Clutter uses OpenGL for rendering.

The Clutter Perl bindings allow you to write canvas-based applications in
a Perlish and object-oriented way, freeing you from having to care about
casting and memory management of the original Clutter C API, and yet
remaining close to its spirit.
