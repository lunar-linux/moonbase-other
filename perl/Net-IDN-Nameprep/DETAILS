cat << EOF
This module implements the nameprep specification,
which describes how to prepare internationalized
domain name (IDN) labels in order to increase
the likelihood that name input and name comparison work
in ways that make sense for typical users throughout
the world. Nameprep is a profile of the stringprep protocol
and is used as part of a suite of on-the-wire protocols
for internationalizing the Domain Name System (DNS).
