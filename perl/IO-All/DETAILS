cat << EOF
IO::All combines all of the best Perl IO modules into a single Spiffy object
oriented interface to greatly simplify your everyday Perl IO idioms. It
exports a single function called "io", which returns a new IO::All object.
And that object can do it all!

The IO::All object is a proxy for IO::File, IO::Dir, IO::Socket, IO::String,
Tie::File, File::Spec, File::Path and File::ReadBackwards; as well as all the
DBM and MLDBM modules. You can use most of the methods found in these classes
and in IO::Handle (which they inherit from). IO::All adds dozens of other
helpful idiomatic methods including file stat and manipulation functions.
