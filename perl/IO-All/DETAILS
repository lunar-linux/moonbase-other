IO::All combines all of the best Perl IO modules into a single Spiffy object oriented interface to greatly simplify your everyday Perl IO
idioms. It exports a single function called "io", which returns a new IO::All object. And that object can do it all!

The IO::All object is a proxy for IO::File, IO::Dir, IO::Socket, IO::String, Tie::File, File::Spec, File::Path and File::ReadBackwards;
as well as all the DBM and MLDBM modules. You can use most of the methods found in these classes and in IO::Handle (which they inherit
from). IO::All adds dozens of other helpful idiomatic methods including file stat and manipulation functions.
