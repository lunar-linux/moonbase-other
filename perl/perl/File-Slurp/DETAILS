Perl module for efficient reading/writing of complete files.

This module provides subs that allow you to read or write entire
files with one simple call. They are designed to be simple to use,
have flexible ways to pass in or get the file contents and to be
very efficient. There is also a sub to read in all the files in a
directory other than . and ..

These slurp/spew subs work for files, pipes and sockets, and stdio,
pseudo-files, and DATA.
