cat << EOF
This module is designed to support operations commonly performed
on file specifications (usually called "file names", but not to be
confused with the contents of a file, or Perl's file handles), such as
concatenating several directory and file names into a single path, or
determining whether a path is rooted. It is based on code directly taken
from MakeMaker 5.17, code written by Andreas König, Andy Dougherty,
Charles Bailey, Ilya Zakharevich, Paul Schinder, and others.
