WWW::Mechanize, or Mech for short, helps you automate interaction
with a website. It supports performing a sequence of page fetches
including following links and submitting forms. Each fetched page
is parsed and its links and forms are extracted. A link or a form
can be selected, form fields can be filled and the next page can
be fetched. Mech also stores a history of the URLs you've visited,
which can be queried and revisited.
