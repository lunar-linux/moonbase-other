cat << EOF
This module provides perl access to GLib and GLib's GObject libraries. GLib
is a portability and utility library; GObject provides a generic type
system with inheritance and a powerful signal system. Together these
libraries are used as the foundation for many of the libraries that make
up the Gnome environment, and are used in many unrelated projects.
