cat << EOF
Date::Calc:

A perl 5 module which is a toolbox for all kinds of date calculations
based on the Gregorian calendar.  The module of course handles year numbers
of 2000 and above correctly -- actually all year numbers from 1 to
the larges postive integer representable on your system (which is at least
32767) can be dealt with.  Note that this package projects the Gregorian
calendar back until the year 1 A.D. -- even though the Gregorian calendar
was only adopted in 1582.
