cat << EOF
This module is a true drop-in replacement for IO::Socket::INET that
uses SSL to encrypt data before it is transferred to a remote server
or client. IO::Socket::SSL supports all the extra features that one
needs to write a full-featured SSL client or server application:
multiple SSL contexts, cipher selection, certificate verification,
and SSL version selection. As an extra bonus, it works perfectly
with mod_perl.
