This module uses the DTD contained in an XML::Doctype to enable compile- and
run-time checks of XML output validity. It also provides methods and functions
named after the elements mentioned in the DTD. If an XML::ValidWriter uses a
DTD that mentions the element type TABLE, that instance will provide the
methods.
