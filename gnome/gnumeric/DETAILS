The Gnumeric spreadsheet is part of the GNOME desktop environment: a
project to create a free, user friendly desktop environment. As every
other component of GNOME, Gnumeric is free software (Some other people
like to call this OpenSource software) and it is licensed under the terms
of the GNU GPL.

Gnumeric is intended to be a drop in replacement for commercial
spreadsheets. We are not attempting to clone existing applications.
However, we offer a customizable feel that attempts to minimize the costs
of transition.

Gnumeric will import your existing Excel, 1-2-3, Applix, Sylk, XBase and
Oleo files. If you are a developer and you want to contribute new
importers (or polishing and perfect existing importers) we welcome your
patches.

The Gnumeric spreadsheet is developed with the GNU C compiler and the
user interface is prototyped and designed using the Glade GUI designer
