Lokkit is an attempt to provide firewalling for the average Linux end
user. Instead of having to configure firewall rules the Lokkit program
asks a small number of simple questions and writes a firewall rule set
for you.
Lokkit is not designed to configure arbitary firewalls. To make it
simple to understand it is solely designed to handle typical dialup user
and cable modem setups. It is not the answer to a complex firewall
configuration, and it is not the equal of an expert firewall designer.
