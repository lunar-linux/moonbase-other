ORBit is a CORBA 2.2-compliant Object Request Broker (ORB) featuring
mature C and Perl bindings. Bindings (in various degrees of
completeness) are also available for C++, Lisp, Pascal, Python, Ruby,
and TCL; others are in-progress. It supports POA, DII, DSI, TypeCode,
Any, IR and IIOP.
Optional features including INS and threading are available. ORBit is
engineered for the desktop workstation environment, with a focus on
performance, low resource usage, and security.
The core ORB is written in C, and runs under Linux, UNIX (BSD, Solaris,
HP-UX, ...), and Windows. ORBit is developed and released as open source
software under GPL/LGPL.
* Note also includes libIDL and will overwrite a pre-existing
installation of libIDL
