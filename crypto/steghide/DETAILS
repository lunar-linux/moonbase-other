cat << EOF
Steghide is a steganography program that is able to hide data in various
kinds of image- and audio-files. The color- respectivly sample-frequencies
are not changed thus making the embedding resistant against first-order
statistical tests.
Features include the compression of the embedded data, encryption of the
embedded data and automatic integrity checking using a checksum. The JPEG,
BMP, WAV and AU file formats are supported for use as a cover file. There are
no restrictions on the format of the secret data.
