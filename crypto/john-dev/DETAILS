John the Ripper is a fast password cracker, currently available for 
many flavors of Unix (11 are officially supported, not counting 
different architectures), DOS, Win32, and BeOS. Its primary purpose 
is to detect weak Unix passwords, but a number of other hash types 
are supported as well. Development version is faster :=)
