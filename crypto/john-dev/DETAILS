cat << EOF
John the Ripper is a fast password cracker, currently available
for many flavors of Unix (11 are officially supported, not 
counting different architectures), DOS, Win32, and BeOS. Its
primary purpose is to detect weak Unix passwords, but a number 
of other hash types are supported as well.

Development version is faster :=)
