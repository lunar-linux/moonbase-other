GnuPG 1.9 is the future version of GnuPG.
You should use this GnuPG version if you want to use the gpg-agent or
gpgsm (the S/MIME variant of gpg). Note that the gpg-agent is also
helpful when using the standard gpg versions.
After installation you have a working GnuPG with support for
S/MIME and smartcards. Note that there is no binary gpg but a gpg2 so
that this package won't confict with a standard GnuPG installation.
The gpg2 behaves just like gpg; it is however suggested to
keep using standard gpg. The gpg2 is not even build by default in Lunar,
the standard gnupg is installed instead.
