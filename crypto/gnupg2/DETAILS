GnuPG is GNU's tool for secure communication and data storage. It can
be used to encrypt data and to create digital signatures. It includes
an advanced key management facility and is compliant with the proposed
OpenPGP Internet standard as described in RFC2440 and the S/MIME
standard as described by several RFCs.
GnuPG 2.0.x is the stable version of GnuPG integrating support for
OpenPGP and S/MIME. It has a different design philosophy that splits
functionality up into several modules.  Both versions may be installed
simultaneously without any conflict (gpg is called gpg2 in GnuPG 2).
In fact, the gpg version from GnuPG 1.4.x is able to make use of the
gpg-agent as included in GnuPG 2 and allows for seamless passphrase
caching. The advantage of GnupG 1.4.x is its smaller size and no
dependency on other modules at run and build time.
The gpg2 behaves just like gpg; it is however suggested to
keep using standard gpg because most applications still need classic 
gnupg.
