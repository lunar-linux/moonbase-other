cat << EOF
This is the reference C implementation of Argon2, the password-hashing function
that won the Password Hashing Competition (PHC).
Argon2 is a password-hashing function that summarizes the state of the art in
the design of memory-hard functions and can be used to hash passwords for
credential storage, key derivation, or other applications.

It has a simple design aimed at the highest memory filling rate and effective
use of multiple computing units, while still providing defense against tradeoff
attacks (by exploiting the cache and memory organization of the recent
processors).

Argon2 has three variants: Argon2i, Argon2d, and Argon2id. Argon2d is faster and
uses data-depending memory access, which makes it highly resistant against GPU
cracking attacks and suitable for applications with no threats from side-channel
timing attacks (eg. cryptocurrencies). Argon2i instead uses data-independent
memory access, which is preferred for password hashing and password-based key
derivation, but it is slower as it makes more passes over the memory to protect
from tradeoff attacks. Argon2id is a hybrid of Argon2i and Argon2d, using a
combination of data-depending and data-independent memory accesses, which gives
some of Argon2i's resistance to side-channel cache timing attacks and much of
Argon2d's resistance to GPU cracking attacks.

Argon2i, Argon2d, and Argon2id are parametrized by:
  - A time cost, which defines the amount of computation realized and therefore
    the execution time, given in number of iterations
  - A memory cost, which defines the memory usage, given in kibibytes
  - A parallelism degree, which defines the number of parallel threads.
