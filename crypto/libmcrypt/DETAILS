cat << EOF
Libmcrypt is a library which provides a uniform interface to several
symmetric encryption algorithms. It is intended to have a simple
interface to access encryption algorithms in ofb, cbc, cfb, and ecb
modes. The algorithms it supports are DES, 3DES, RIJNDAEL, Twofish,
IDEA, GOST, CAST-256, ARCFOUR, SERPENT, SAFER+, and more. The
algorithms and modes are also modular so you can add and remove them
on the fly without recompiling the library.
