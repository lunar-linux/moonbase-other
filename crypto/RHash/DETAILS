RHash (Recursive Hasher) is a console utility for calculation and verification
of magnet links and various message digests, including CRC32, CRC32C, MD4, MD5,
SHA1, SHA256, SHA512, SHA3, AICH, ED2K, DC++ TTH, BitTorrent BTIH, Tiger,
GOST R 34.11-94, GOST R 34.11-2012, RIPEMD-160, HAS-160, EDON-R, and Whirlpool.
Message digests are used to ensure and verify integrity of large volumes of
data
for a long-term storing or transferring.
Program features:
Ability to process directories recursively.
Output in a predefined (SFV, BSD-like) or a user-defined format.
Calculation of Magnet links.
Updating hash files (adding message digests of files missing in the hash file).
Calculates several message digests in one pass.
Portability: the program works the same on Linux, Unix, macOS or Windows.
