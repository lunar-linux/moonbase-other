GnuPG is GNU's tool for secure communication and data storage. It can be used
to encrypt data and to create digital signatures. It includes an advanced key
management facility and is compliant with the proposed OpenPGP Internet standard
as described in RFC2440 and the S/MIME standard as described by several RFCs.
GnuPG 2.0.x is the stable version of GnuPG integrating support for OpenPGP and
S/MIME. It has a different design philosophy that splits functionality up into
several modules.  Both versions may be installed simultaneously without any
conflict (gpg is called gpg2 in GnuPG 2).
In fact, the gpg version from GnuPG 1.4.x is able to make use of the gpg-agent
as included in GnuPG 2 and allows for seamless passphrase caching. The advantage
of GnupG 1.4.x is its smaller size and no dependency on other modules at run and
build time.
