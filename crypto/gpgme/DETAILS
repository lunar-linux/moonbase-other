cat << EOF
GnuPG Made Easy (GPGME) is a library designed to make access to
GnuPG easier for applications. It provides a High-Level Crypto
API for encryption, decryption, signing, signature verification
and key management. Currently it uses GnuPG as it's backend
but the API isn't restricted to this engine; in fact it is planned
to add other backends to it.
