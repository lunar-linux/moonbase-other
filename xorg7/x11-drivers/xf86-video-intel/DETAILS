cat << EOF
xf86-video-intel provides the X.Org video driver for the Intel i8xx
and i9xx family of integrated graphics chipsets.  This includes the 
i810, i815, i830, i845, i855, i865, i915, i945 and i965 series chips.

The driver supports depths 8, 15, 16 and 24.  All visual types are 
supported in depth 8.  For the i810/i815 other depths support the 
TrueColor and DirectColor visuals. 

For the 830M and later, only the TrueColor visual is supported for 
depths greater than 8.  The driver supports hardware accelerated 3D
via the Direct Rendering Infrastructure (DRI), but only in depth 16
for the i810/i815 and depths 16 and 24 for the 830M and later.
