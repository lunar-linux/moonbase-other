cat << EOF
The X11R7.5 version of the core X Window System documentation - but with
many of the docs moved out to the modules for the protocols and software
they document, the core is much smaller than it used to be.

This module also no longer contains the out-of-date pre-created PostScript
versions of the documents - we are working to generate those all at build
time when the appropriate tools are installed so they will not drift out
of sync again in the future.
