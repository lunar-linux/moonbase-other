Xman is a manual page browser. The default size of the initial xman window is
small so that you can leave it running throughout your entire login session. 
In the initial window there are three options: Help will pop up a window with 
on-line help, Quit will exit, and Manual Page will pop up a window with a 
manual page browser in it. Typing Control-S will pop up a window prompting for 
a specific manual page to display. You may display more than one manual page 
browser window at a time from a single execution of xman.
