Luit is a filter that can be run between an arbitrary application and a
UTF-8 terminal emulator.  It will convert application output from the
locale's encoding into UTF-8, and convert terminal input from UTF-8
into the locale's encoding.

An application may also request to a different output encoding using
ISO 2022 and ISO 6429 escape sequences.  Use of this feature is
discouraged: multilingual applications should be modified to directly
generate UTF-8 instead.
