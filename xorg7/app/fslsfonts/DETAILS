fslsfonts lists the fonts that match the given pattern. The wildcard
character "*" may be used to match any sequence of characters
(including none), and "?" to match any single character. If no pattern
is given, "*" is assumed. The "*" and "?" characters must be quoted
to prevent them from being expanded by the shell.
