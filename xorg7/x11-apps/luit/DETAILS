Luit is a filter that can be run between an arbitrary application and a
UTF-8 terminal emulator.  It will convert application output from the 
locale's encoding into UTF-8, and convert terminal input from UTF-8 
into the locale's encoding.

An application may also request to a different output encoding using 
ISO 2022 and ISO 6429 escape sequences.  Use of this feature is 
discouraged: multilingual applications should be modified to directly 
generate UTF-8 instead.
