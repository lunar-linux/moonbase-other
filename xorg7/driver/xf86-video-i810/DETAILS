cat << EOF
xf86-video-i810 provides the X.Org video driver for the Intel i8xx
and i9xx family of integrated graphics chipsets.  This includes the
i810, i815, i830, i845, i855, i865, i915, and i945 series chips.

The driver supports depths 8, 15, 16 and 24.  All visual types are
supported in depth 8.  For the i810/i815 other depths support the
TrueColor and DirectColor visuals.

For the 830M and later, only the TrueColor visual is supported for
depths greater than 8.  The driver supports hardware accelerated 3D
via the Direct Rendering Infrastructure (DRI), but only in depth 16
for the i810/i815 and depths 16 and 24 for the 830M and later.
