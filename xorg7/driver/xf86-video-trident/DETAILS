cat << EOF
xf86-video-trident provides the X.Org video driver for VIA/S3 CLE266,
KM400/KN400/K8M800 UniChrome based video cards which are frequently
found in low form-factor VIA motherboards, and in some laptops.
Flat panel, TV and VGA outputs are supported.

K8M800/K8N800, PM8X0 and CN400 support is still under development.

Direct rendering 3D is available using experimental drivers in Mesa.
Also there is an XvMC client library for hardware MPEG1/MPEG2 decoding
acceleration available on the CLE266 and K8M/N800 chipsets that uses
the DRI. The XvMC client library implements a nonstandard '34'VLD'34'
extension to the XvMC standard.
