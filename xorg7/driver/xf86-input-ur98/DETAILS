cat << EOF
The UR-98 driver functions as a pointer input device, and can be used either
as an additional input device or as the X server's core pointer. The driver
provides support for the three axes, throttle and four buttons of the
controller. If mapped as the core pointer the headtracker provides headtracking
to try and place the mouse cursor where you look. As a secondary input device
the unit can be used for gaming, for example to provide the look up/down and
the turn in quake, and with the Z axis bound to ack/forward to provide
movement control.
