xf86-video-vesa provides the X.Org generic VESA video driver.  This
driver uses the standard VESA interface provided on all video cards.
Note that this driver runs completely unaccelerated and is not
recommended for normal daily use, however it is good to have available
in case your video card's normal driver is experiencing problems.
