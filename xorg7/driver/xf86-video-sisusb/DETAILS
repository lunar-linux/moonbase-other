xf86-video-sisusb provides the X.Org video drivers for SiS (Silicon
Integrated Systems) based video chips that are connected via a Net2280
USB dongle.

The driver is not accelerated, but provides support for colordepths of
8, 16 and 24 bpp as well as Render and other extensions. 

The sisusb driver supports USB video cards based on the following 
chipsets: 
 SiS315E/PRO 

The SiS315E/PRO features two CRT controllers.  However, in its USB
version, only the first output, referred to as "CRT1", is being used.
