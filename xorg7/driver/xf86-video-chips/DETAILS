cat << EOF
xf86-video-chips provides the X.Org video drivers for the Chips & 
Technologies family of video cards.

The majority of the Chips & Technologies chipsets are supported by 
this driver.  In general the limitation on the capabilities of this
driver are determined by the chipset on which it is run.  Where 
possible, this driver provides full acceleration and supports the
following depths: 1, 4, 8, 15, 16, 24 and on the latest chipsets an
8+16 overlay mode.  All visual types are supported for depth 1, 4,
and 8 and both TrueColor and DirectColor visuals are supported where
possible.  Multi-head configurations are supported on PCI or AGP 
buses.
