cat << EOF
xf86-video-glint provides the X.Org video driver for the Texas
Instruments/3DLabs Glint and Permedia family of video cards. The
driver is rather fully accelerated, and provides support for the
following framebuffer depths: 8, 15 (may give bad results with FBDev
support), 16, 24 (32 bpp recommended, 24 bpp has problems), 30, and
an 8+24 overlay mode.
