xf86-video-cyrix provides the X.Org video drivers for the Cyrix family
of video cards.  This driver supports the MediaGX, MediaGXi and
MediaGXm processors, as well as the Natsemi 'Geode' branded processors.
It supports the CS5510, CS5520, CS5530 and CS5530A companion chips.
The driver supports 4, 8, 15, and 16 bit deep displays with video
compression and acceleration.

The MediaGX run length compresses its shared framebuffer, for the best
performance on a MediaGX machine pick backgrounds that compress well
horizonally.
