cat << EOF
A library for reading and writing gif images. It is binary compatible
with libungif. This library use LZW compression in the gif format (the
Unisys patent on it expired in 2004). Unless you really need to write
compressed gifs, I would suggest libungif (available from the same sites
as this library) as a better alternative.
