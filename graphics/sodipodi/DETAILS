Sodipodi is a vector-based drawing program, like CorelDraw or Adobe Illustrator
from the proprietary software world, and Sketch or Kontour from the free
software world. It is a free software, distributed under the terms of the Gnu
General Public License, Version 2. Sodipodi uses W3C SVG as its native file
format. It is therefore a very useful tool for web designers. It has a
relatively modern display engine, giving you finely antialiased display, alpha
transparencies, vector fonts and so on. Sodipodi is written in C, using Gtk+
toolkit and some Gnome libraries.
