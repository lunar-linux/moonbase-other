XaoS is a fast, portable, real-time, and interactive fractal zoomer.
It displays the Mandelbrot set (among other escape time fractals) and
allows you zoom smoothly into the fractal. Various coloring modes are
provided for both the points inside and outside the selected set. In
addition, switching between Julia and Mandelbrot fractal types and
on-the-fly plane switching is provided.
