XBMC is an award-winning free and open source (GPL) software media
player and entertainment hub for digital media. XBMC is available
for Linux, OSX, and Windows. Created in 2003 by a group of like
minded programmers, XBMC is a non-profit project run and developed by
volunteers located around the world. More than 50 software developers
have contributed to XBMC, and 100-plus translators have worked to
expand its reach, making it available in more than 30 languages.

While XBMC functions very well as a standard media player application
for your computer, it has been designed to be the perfect companion
for your HTPC. Supporting an almost endless range of remote controls,
and combined with its beautiful interface and powerful skinning engine,
XBMC feels very natural to use from the couch and is the ideal solution
for your home theater.

Currently XBMC can be used to play almost all popular audio and video
formats around. It was designed for network playback, so you can
stream your multimedia from anywhere in the house or directly from
the internet using practically any protocol available. Use your media
as-is: XBMC can play CDs and DVDs directly from the disk or image file,
almost all popular archive formats from your hard drive, and even files
inside ZIP and RAR archives. It will even scan all of your media and
automatically create a personalized library complete with box covers,
descriptions, and fanart. There are playlist and slideshow functions, a
weather forecast feature and many audio visualizations. Once installed,
your computer will become a fully functional multimedia jukebox.
