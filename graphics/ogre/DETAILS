cat << EOF
OGRE (Object-Oriented Graphics Rendering Engine) is a scene-oriented, flexible 
3D engine written in C++ designed to make it easier and more intuitive for 
developers to produce applications utilising hardware-accelerated 3D graphics. 
The class library abstracts all the details of using the underlying system 
libraries like Direct3D and OpenGL and provides an interface based on world 
objects and other intuitive classes.
