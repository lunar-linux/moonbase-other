cat << EOF
graphviz is a set of graph drawing tools for Unix or MS-Windows (win32). Source
code and binary executables for common platforms are available. Graph drawing
addresses the problem of visualizing structural information by constructing
geometric representations of abstract graphs and networks.
Automatic generation of graph drawings has important applications in key
technologies such as database design, software engineering, VLSI and network
design and visual interfaces in other domains.
