cat << EOF
graphviz  is a set of graph drawing tools for Unix or MS-Windows (win32), 
including a web service interface (webdot). Source code and binary executables 
for common platforms are available. Graph drawing addresses the problem of 
visualizing structural information by constructing geometric representations of 
abstract graphs and networks. Automatic generation of graph drawings has 
important applications in key technologies such as database design, software 
engineering, VLSI and network design and visual interfaces in other domains.
