cat << EOF
graphviz is a set of graph drawing tools for Unix or MS-Windows
(win32). Source code and binary executables for common platforms
are available. Graph drawing addresses the problem of visualizing
structural information by constructing geometric representations of
abstract graphs and networks. Automatic generation of graph drawings
has important applications in key technologies such as database design,
software engineering, VLSI and network design and visual interfaces
in other domains.
