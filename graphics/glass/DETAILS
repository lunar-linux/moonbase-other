cat << EOF
GLASS is a 3D library, designed to make easy use of structured models
in open GL applications. What do I mean by structured? That is models,
that are made up of components linked by basic transforms, for example,
rotations and translations. By using GLASS in an application, these
models can be loaded, modified, and displayed using a minimum of
function calls. GLASS is released under the terms of the GNU GPL.
