LibGII (General Input Interface) is intended to be to input what our LibGGI
(General Graphics Interface) library is to graphics.

LibGII is based on the concept of input streams, which virtualize access
to the underlying input drivers. Events from various input devices are
abstracted into easy-to-use structures. LibGII also allows the application to
join streams together, receiving input from an arbitrary combination of
devices. LibGII is a separate component from LibGGI, although LibGGI
depends on LibGII for input purposes.
