cat << EOF
 GMIC is a full-featured open-source framework for digital image processing, distributed under the
 CeCILL free software licenses (LGPL-like and/or GPL-compatible). It provides several user interfaces
 to convert / process / visualize generic image datasets, ranging from 1D scalar signals to 3D+t
 sequences of multi-spectral volumetric images, hence including 2D color images. 
 
 This module contains GUIs for GMIC - a QT5 standalone app, and plugins for GIMP, Krita, and DigiKam.
