What is Inkscape?

Inkscape is a Free and open source vector graphics editor for GNU/Linux,
Windows and MacOS X. It offers a rich set of features and is widely
used for both artistic and technical illustrations such as cartoons,
clip art, logos, typography, diagramming and flowcharting. It uses
vector graphics to allow for sharp printouts and renderings at
unlimited resolution and is not bound to a fixed number of pixels like
raster graphics. Inkscape uses the standardized SVG file format as its
main format, which is supported by many other applications including
web browsers.
