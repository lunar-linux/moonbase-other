cat << EOF
Inkscape seeks to become a full featured open source SVG editor. Derived
from the highly popular Sodipodi codebase, Inkscape strives to build
full XML, SVG, and CSS2 compliance, convert the codebase from C/Gtk to
C++/Gtkmm, emphasizes a lightweight core with powerful features added
through an extension mechanism, and promotes friendly, open, community-
oriented development processes.
