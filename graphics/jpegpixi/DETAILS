Correct images from a digital camera with CCD defects.

Jpegpixi is unique in that it tries to preserve the quality of the JPEG image
as much as possible. Usual graphics programs decode JPEG images when they are
loaded, and re-encode them when they are saved, which results in an overall
loss of quality. Jpegpixi, on the other hand, only decodes the DCT blocks
(typically 8×8, 16×8, or 16×16 pixel areas) which contain pixels to be
interpolated, and when it re-encodes them, it uses exactly the same parameters
with which the image has originally been encoded. These blocks are therefore
only minimally disturbed, and other blocks remain pixel-by-pixel identical to
the original image.
