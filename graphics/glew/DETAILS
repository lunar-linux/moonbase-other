           SHORT="The OpenGL Extension Wrangler Library"

cat << EOF
The goal of the OpenGL Extension Wrangler Library (GLEW) is to assist C/C++
OpenGL developers with two tedious tasks: initializing and using extensions and
writing portable applications. GLEW provides an efficient run-time mechanism to
determine whether a certain extension is supported by the driver or not.
OpenGL core and extension functionality is exposed via a single header file.
GLEW currently supports a variety of platforms and operating systems, including
Windows, Linux, Darwin, Irix, and Solaris.
