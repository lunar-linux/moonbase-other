cat << EOF
The GLUT API is intended for small to medium sized OpenGL Programs. It's
well suited for basic UI:s, and crossplatform applications. The GLUT
library supports the following functionality: multiple windows for
OpenGL rendering, callback driven event processing, an 'idle' routine
and timers, utility routines to generate various solid and wire frame
objects, support for bitmap and stroke fonts, as well as miscellaneous
window management functions.
