Aewan is a curses-based program that allows for the creation and editing of
ASCII art.  The user is able to move the cursor around the screen by means
of the arrow keys and 'paint' characters by pressing the corresponding
keys.  There are dialog boxes that allow the user to choose foreground and
background colors, as well as bold and blink attributes.  The user may also
select rectangular areas of the canvas in order to move, copy and paste
them. 

What sets Aewan apart from similar projects is the fact that it can work 
with multiple layers, and has the ability to turn transparency and
visibility on and off for each layer.
