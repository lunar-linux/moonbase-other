cat << EOF
Open source implementation of High-throughput JPEG2000 (HTJ2K), also known as JPH,
JPEG2000 Part 15, ISO/IEC 15444-15, and ITU-T T.814. Here, we are interested in
implementing the HTJ2K only, supporting features that are defined in JPEG2000
Part 1 (for example, for wavelet transform, only reversible 5/3 and irreversible
9/7 are supported).
