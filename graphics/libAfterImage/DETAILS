It was initially implemented to address AfterStep Window Manager's needs for
image handling, but it evolved into extremely powerfull and flexible software,
suitable for virtually any project that has needs for loading, manipulating,
displaying images, as well as writing images in files. Most of the popular
image formats are supported using standard libraries, with XCF, XPM, PPM/PNM,
BMP, ICO, TGA and GIF being supported internally.
