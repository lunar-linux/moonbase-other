cat << EOF
 GMIC is a full-featured open-source framework for digital image processing, distributed under the CeCILL free software licenses (LGPL-like and/or GPL-compatible). It provides several user interfaces to convert / process / visualize generic image datasets, ranging from 1D scalar signals to 3D+t sequences of multi-spectral volumetric images, hence including 2D color images. 
 
 This module only contains the GMIC libraries and the command line interface. For GUI interfaces, install gmic-qt as well.
