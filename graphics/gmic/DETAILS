cat << EOF
GMIC is a full-featured open-source framework for digital image processing, distributed under the
CeCILL free software licenses (LGPL-like and/or GPL-compatible). It provides several user interfaces
to convert / process / visualize generic image datasets, ranging from 1D scalar signals to 3D+t
sequences of multi-spectral volumetric images, hence including 2D color images. 

This module only contains the GMIC libraries and the command line interface. 
For GUI interfaces, install gmic-qt as well.
