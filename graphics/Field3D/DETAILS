cat << EOF
Field3D is an open source library for storing voxel data. It provides C++ classes
that handle in-memory storage and a file format based on HDF5 that allows the C++
objects to be written to and read from disk.
Field3D was developed with the needs and scale of visual effects production in mind.
Dense and MAC-fields handle the basic tasks in fluid simulation and volume rendering,
and where memory becomes a limiting factor optimization of used/unused space is
provided by the sparse fields, which include an out-of-core/dynamic loading mechanism. Procedural 
Fields are also supported, which may be used interchangeably with voxel-based fields.
