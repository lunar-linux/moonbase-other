PFScalibration package provides an implementation of the Robertson et al.
2003 method for the photometric calibration of cameras and for the recovery
of high dynamic range (HDR) images from the set of low dynamic range (LDR)
exposures. Tools provided with this software can be used for photometric
calibration of both off-the-shelf digital cameras and HDR cameras as
described in the MPI Research Report.
