Digital photographs are not ideal. Of course, the better is your camera, the
better the results will be, but in any case if you look carefully at shots taken
even by the most expensive cameras equipped with the most expensive lenses you
will see various artifacts. It is very hard to make ideal cameras, because there
are a lot of factors that affect the final image quality, and at some point
camera and lens designers have to trade one factor for another to achieve the
optimal image quality, within the given design restrictions and budget.

But we all want ideal shots, don't we? :) So that's what's lensfun is all about
- rectifying the defects introduced by your photographic equipment.
