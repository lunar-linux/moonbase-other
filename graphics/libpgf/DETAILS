cat << EOF
    *  A new image file format
    * Based on discrete, fast wavelet transform with progressive coding 
      features
    * Lossless and lossy compression
    * Best for natural and aerial images
    * For such images with a better compression efficiency than JPEG
    * PGF is one of the best algorithms available these days for 
      compression of natural images
