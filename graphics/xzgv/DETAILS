xzgv is a picture viewer for X, with a thumbnail-based file selector.  It uses
gtk+ and imlib.  Most file formats are supported and the thumbnails used are
compatible with xv, zgv, and the Gimp.  xzgv differs from other picture viewers
for X in that is uses one window for both the file selector and viewer, it
(unlike xv) allows both scrolling and fit-to-window methods of view large
pictures, and it (unlike xv and some others) doesn't ever mangle the picture's
aspect ration without you telling it to.  Extensive keyboard support.
xzgv has a fair amount in common with the author's original svgalib-based zgv.
