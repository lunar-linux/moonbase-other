cat << EOF
The SDL_gfx library offers several components: Graphic Primitives,
Rotozoomer, Framerate control, and MMX image filters. The Primitives
component provides basic drawing routines: pixels, hlines, vlines,
lines, aa-lines, rectangles, circles, ellipses, polygons, and an 8x8
pixmap font for drawing onto any SDL Surface. Full alpha blending,
hardware surface locking, and all surface depths are supported. The
Rotozoomer can use interpolation for high quality output.
