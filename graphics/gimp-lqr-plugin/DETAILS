cat << EOF
A frontend to the Liquid Rescale Library, which provides an implementation of
the Seam Carving algorithm as described in this paper by Shai Avidan and Ariel
Shamir.

The Seam Carving procedure aims at resizing pictures non uniformly while
preserving their features, i.e. avoiding distortion of the important parts.
The plugin supports manual feature selection, and can also be used to remove
portions of the picture in a consistent way.
