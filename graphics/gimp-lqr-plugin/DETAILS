cat << EOF
A frontend to the Liquid Rescale Library, which provides an implementation of 
the Seam Carving algorithm as described in this paper by Shai Avidan and Ariel
Shamir.

The Seam Carving procedure aims at resizing pictures non uniformly while 
preserving their features, i.e. avoiding distortion of the important parts.
The plugin supports manual feature selection, and can also be used to remove 
portions of the picture in a consistent way.
