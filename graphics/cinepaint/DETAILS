CinePaint is a collection of free open source software tools for deep
paint manipulation and image processing. CinePaint is used for motion
picture frame-by-frame retouching, dirt removal, wire rig removal,
render repair, background plates, and 3d model textures. It's been used
on many feature films, including The Last Samurai where it was used to
add flying arrows. It's also being used by pro photographers who need
greater color fidelity than is available in other tools.
