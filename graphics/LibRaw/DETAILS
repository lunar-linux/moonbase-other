LibRaw is a library for reading RAW files obtained from digital photo 
cameras (CRW/CR2, NEF, RAF, DNG, and others). 
LibRaw is based on the source codes of the dcraw utility, where part of 
drawbacks have already been eliminated and part will be fixed in future. 
The users of the library are provided with API to be built into their 
software programs.
