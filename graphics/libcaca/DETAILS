The libcaca library is a graphics library that outputs text instead of
pixels, so that it can work on older video cards or text terminals. It
is not unlike the famous AAlib library. libcaca needs a terminal to
work, thus it should work on all Unix systems (including Mac OS X)
using either the slang library or the ncurses library, on DOS using
the conio library, and on Windows systems using either slang or
ncurses (through Cygwin emulation) or conio.
