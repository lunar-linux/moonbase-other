cat << EOF
GraphicsMagick is the swiss army knife of image processing. It provides
a robust collection of tools and libraries which support reading,
writing, and manipulating an image in over 88 major formats including
important formats like DPX, GIF, JPEG, JPEG-2000, PNG, PDF, SVG, and TIFF.
GraphicsMagick supports huge images on systems that support large files,
and has been tested with gigapixel-size images.
