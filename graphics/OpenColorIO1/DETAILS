Note: This is an older version of OpenColorIO and needed for krita-4.4.5.

OpenColorIO (OCIO) is a complete color management solution geared towards motion
picture production with an emphasis on visual effects and computer animation. 
OCIO provides a straightforward and consistent user experience across all 
supporting applications while allowing for sophisticated back-end configuration 
options suitable for high-end production usage. OCIO is compatible with the 
Academy Color Encoding Specification (ACES) and is LUT-format agnostic, 
supporting many popular formats.
