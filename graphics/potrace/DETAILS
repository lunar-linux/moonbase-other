cat << EOF
Potrace is a utility for tracing a bitmap, which means, transforming
a bitmap into a smooth, scalable image. The input is a bitmap (PBM, PGM,
PPM, or BMP format), and the default output is an encapsulated PostScript
file (EPS). A typical use is to create EPS files from scanned data, such
as company or university logos, handwritten notes, etc. The resulting
image is not "jaggy" like a bitmap, but smooth. It can then be rendered
at any resolution.
