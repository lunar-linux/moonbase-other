NetPBM (formerly PBMplus) is a package of over 220 programs that convert from
one graphics format to another and do simple editing and analysis of images.
There are no interactive tools in this package, and nothing that displays
graphics of any kind. Over 80 graphics formats are handled, including JPEG,
PNG, GIF, TIFF, BMP, XWD, XBM, G3 fax, and special formats used by digital
cameras and handheld computers. Over 40 editing functions include scaling,
cropping, quantization and dithering, colorizing and uncolorizing, blurring,
and dimming. Netpbm programs are often invoked by other programs, for example
in CGI scripts that manage web site graphics. It also includes a C function
library which helps you write programs to process graphics at a lower level
than the Netpbm utilities.
