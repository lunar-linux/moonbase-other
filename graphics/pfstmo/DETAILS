cat << EOF
pfstmo package contains the implementation of state-of-the-art tone mapping
operators. The motivation here is to provide an implementation of tone
mapping operators suitable for convenient processing of both static images
and animations.

The operators are embedded in a flexible framework [pfstools] which provides
a unified input/output mechanism and a modular architecture for the filtering
of the image data. Various file formats for static images and video are
transparently supported and the High Dynamic Range data are processed modularly
through a Unix piping mechanism.
