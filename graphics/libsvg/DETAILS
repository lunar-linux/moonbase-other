cat << EOF
libsvg does not do any rendering, but instead provides a
function-based interface that can be used by various rendering
engines.

It is anticipated that the primary uses of libsvg would be in small
libraries that connect the libsvg parser to a rendering engine. Those
libraries, in turn, would provide the capability to applications to
directly render SVG content from files or buffers.
