cat << EOF
Graphite2 is a rendering engine for graphite fonts. These are TrueType fonts
with additional tables containing smart rendering information and were
originally developed to support complex non-Roman writing systems. They may \
contain rules for e.g. ligatures, glyph substitution, kerning, justification -
this can make them useful even on text written in Roman writing systems such as
English. Note that firefox provides an internal copy of the graphite engine and
cannot use a system version, but it too should benefit from the availability of
graphite fonts.
