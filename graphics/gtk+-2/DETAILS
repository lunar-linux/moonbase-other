cat << EOF
GTK+ is a multi-platform toolkit for creating graphical user interfaces.
Offering a complete set of widgets, GTK+-2 is suitable for projects
ranging from small one-off tools to complete application suites.

GTK+-2 has been designed from the ground up to support a range of
languages, not only C/C++.  Using GTK+-2 from languages such as Perl
and Python (especially in combination with the Glade GUI builder)
provides an effective method of rapid application development.
