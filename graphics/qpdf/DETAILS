cat << EOF
QPDF is a command-line program that does structural, content-preserving
transformations on PDF files. It could have been called something like
pdf-to-pdf. It also provides many useful capabilities to developers of
PDF-producing software or for people who just want to look at the innards
of a PDF file to learn more about how they work.
QPDF is capable of creating linearized (also known as web-optimized) files
and encrypted files. It is also capable of converting PDF files with object
streams (also known as compressed objects) to files with no compressed objects
or to generate object streams from files that don't have them (or even those
that already do). QPDF also supports a special mode designed to allow you to
edit the content of PDF files in a text editor.
