QPDF is a command-line program that does structural, content-preserving transformations 
on PDF files. It could have been called something like pdf-to-pdf. It also provides many 
useful capabilities to developers of PDF-producing software or for people who just want 
to look at the innards of a PDF file to learn more about how they work.

QPDF is capable of creating linearized (also known as web-optimized) files and encrypted 
files. It is also capable of converting PDF files with object streams (also known as 
compressed objects) to files with no compressed objects or to generate object streams 
from files that don't have them (or even those that already do). QPDF also supports a 
special mode designed to allow you to edit the content of PDF files in a text editor.
