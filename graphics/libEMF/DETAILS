libEMF is a C/C++ library which provides a drawing toolkit based on ECMA-234.
The general purpose of this library is to create vector graphics files on
POSIX systems which can be imported into StarOffice/OpenOffice. The Enhanced
MetaFile (EMF) is one of the two color vector graphics format which is
"vectorially" understood by SO/OO. (SO/OO can import Encapsulated PostScript
files, but will only display it if it has a bitmap preview image.

My general interest in this library is for making scientific plots with gnuplot
and Grace(forthcoming). Therefore, this software includes patches to those
programs to add the EMF as an output option. This library is mostly limited to
the graphics commands required for gnuplot and Grace output drivers, though
it's trivial to add new ones.

It is also possible now to generate EMF files from PSTOEDIT on POSIX systems.
Therefore, if your graphics code only outputs PostScript, you can now easily
convert it to EMF.
