The Direct Rendering Infrastructure, also known as the DRI, is a framework
for allowing direct access to graphics hardware in a safe and efficient
manner. It includes changes to the X server, to several client libraries,
and to the kernel. The first major use for the DRI is to create fast OpenGL
implementations.

The DRI was initially developed by Precision Insight, Inc. (PI) in
cooperation with, and partially funded by Red Hat Inc., and SGI. Since PI's
merger with VA Linux, and VA Linux' subsequent exit from Linux, the DRI is
being maintained by Tungsten Graphics Inc., a new company formed by some of
the initial DRI developers from PI.

The DRI is an integral part of XFree86 4.x, and integrates with Mesa, an open
source implementation of the OpenGL API. Several 3D accelerated drivers have
been written to the DRI specification, including drivers for chipsets produced
by ATI, Matrox, 3dfx, and Intel. Tungsten Graphics is the current focal point
for all DRI development, and many open source developers continue to contribute
to the project through the DRI sourceforge project.
