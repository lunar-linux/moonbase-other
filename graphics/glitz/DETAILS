cat << EOF
Glitz is an OpenGL image compositing library. Glitz provides
Porter/Duff compositing of images and implicit mask generation
for geometric primitives including trapezoids, triangles, and
rectangles.

The semantics of glitz are designed to precisely match the
specification of the X Render extension. The performance and
capabilities of glitz are much dependent on graphics hardware.
Glitz can be used as a stand-alone layer above OpenGL but is
also designed to act as a backend for cairo, providing it with
OpenGL accelerated output.
