           SHORT="Glitz is an OpenGL image compositing library. "

cat << EOF
Glitz provides Porter/Duff compositing of images and implicit mask 
generation for geometric primitives including trapezoids, triangles, 
and rectangles. 
The semantics of glitz are designed to precisely match the specifica-
tion of the X Render extension. Glitz does not only implement X Render 
features like component alpha and image transformations, but also 
support for additional features like convolution filters and color 
gradients, which are not currently part of the X Render specification. 
Glitz can be used as a stand-alone layer above OpenGL but it is also 
designed to act as a backend for cairo, providing it with OpenGL 
accelerated output.
