# NOTE: This is straight from the ImageMagick devs: Lunar should not be using
# the x.y.z-0 releases. Instead, ONLY when x.y.z-0 is released, then we
# should version bump to x.y.(z-1)-(highest). That version is always
# kept on the ftp.imagemagick.org site and should be considered STABLE!!!

cat << EOF
ImageMagick (TM) is a package for the automated and interative manipulation of
images. It supports the display and interactive manipulation of images when
used with the X Window System. Although the software is copyrighted, it is
available for free and can be redistributed without fee. ImageMagick may be
used as a component of both open source and proprietary applications.
ImageMagick compiles and runs under Unix, Linux, Windows '95 and later, Apple
MacOS, and Compaq VMS. Binary packages are available for most operating systems.
Application programming interfaces (APIs) are provided to support development
of image processing applications in the C, C++, and Perl languages.
