# NOTE: This is straight from the ImageMagick devs: Lunar should not be using
# the x.y.z-0 releases. Instead, ONLY when x.y.z-0 is released, then we
# should version bump to x.y.(z-1)-(highest). That version is always
# kept on the ftp.imagemagick.org site and should be considered STABLE!!!

ImageMagick (TM) is a package for the automated and interative manipulation of
images. It supports the display and interactive manipulation of images when used
with the X Window System. Although the software is copyrighted, it is available
for free and can be redistributed without fee. ImageMagick may be used as a
component of both open source and proprietary applications. ImageMagick compiles
and runs under Unix, Linux, Windows '95 and later, Apple MacOS, and Compaq VMS.
Binary packages are available for most operating systems.
Application programming interfaces (APIs) are provided to support development of
image processing applications in the C, C++, and Perl languages.
