# NOTE: This is straight from the ImageMagick devs: Lunar should not be using
# the x.y.z-0 releases. Instead, ONLY when x.y.z-0 is released, then we
# should version bump to x.y.(z-1)-(highest). That version is always
# kept on the ftp.imagemagick.org site and should be considered STABLE!!!

cat << EOF
ImageMagick (TM) is a package for the automated and interative
manipulation of images. It supports the display and interactive
manipulation of images when used with the X Window System. Although
the software is copyrighted, it is available for free and can be
redistributed without fee. ImageMagick may be used as a component of
both open source and proprietary applications. ImageMagick compiles
and runs under Unix, Linux, Windows '95 and later, Apple MacOS, and
Compaq VMS. Binary packages are available for most operating systems.
Application programming interfaces (APIs) are provided to support
development of image processing applications in the C, C++, and Perl
languages.
