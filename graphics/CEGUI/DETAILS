Crazy Eddie's GUI System is a free library providing windowing
and widgets for graphics APIs / engines where such functionality
is not natively available, or severely lacking. The library is
object-oriented, written in C++, and targeted at game and application
developers who should be spending their time creating great games
and not on building GUI sub-systems!
