cat << EOF
x11-ssh-askpass is a lightweight passphrase dialog for OpenSSH or other
open variants of SSH. In particular, x11-ssh-askpass is useful with the
Unix port of OpenSSH by Damien Miller and others, and Damien includes
it in his RPM packages of OpenSSH.
x11-ssh-askpass uses only the stock X11 libraries (libX11, libXt) for
its user interface. This reduces its dependencies on external libraries
(such as GNOME or Perl/Tk). See the README for further information.
The OpenBSD folks are maintaining their own port of x11-ssh-askpass.
It's available in the X11 section of OpenBSD's anonymous CVS tree.
