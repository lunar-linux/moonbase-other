x11-ssh-askpass is a lightweight passphrase dialog for OpenSSH or other open variants of SSH. In particular, x11-ssh-askpass is useful with the Unix port of OpenSSH by Damien Miller and others, and Damien includes it in his RPM packages of OpenSSH. 


x11-ssh-askpass uses only the stock X11 libraries (libX11, libXt) for its user interface. This reduces its dependencies on external libraries (such as GNOME or Perl/Tk). See the README for further information. 


The OpenBSD folks are maintaining their own port of x11-ssh-askpass. It's available in the X11 section of OpenBSD's anonymous CVS tree.
