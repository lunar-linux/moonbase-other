cat << EOF
MenuMaker is utility written in Python that is capable of finding 
installed programs and generating menus for several supported X 
window managers. It is basically a frontend to library Prophet 
(currently shipped with MenuMaker) - very powerful heuristics-driven 
resource locator.
It features:
    * Large knowledge base (KB) - currently over 500 programs are 
      recognized, 200+ of them are X11-aware - potentional candidates for 
      inclusion into window manager menu.
    * Sophisticated search algorithms - since each KB entry is actually 
      Python class, search algorithm's complexity is limited by nothing.
    * Unique Active Menus feature - dynamic menu regeneration with KDE-style 
      Most Actively Used entries on almost every supported window manager.
    * Ease of use - just a single program call might create menus for several 
      window managers at once.
