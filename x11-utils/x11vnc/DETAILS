x11vnc allows one to view remotely and interact with real X 
displays (i.e. a display corresponding to a physical monitor, 
keyboard, and mouse) with any VNC viewer. In this way it plays the 
role for Unix/X11 that WinVNC plays for Windows.
It has built-in SSL encryption and authentication, UNIX account and 
password support, server-side scaling, single port HTTPS and VNC, and 
TightVNC and UltraVNC file-transfer. It has also been extended to 
work with webcams and TV tuner capture devices and with embedded 
Linux systems such as Qtopia Core.
