cat <<EOF
LightDM is a cross-desktop display manager that aims is to be the standard
display manager for the X.org X server. The motivation for this project is
there have been many new display managers written since XDM (often based on
the XDM source). The main difference between these projects is in the GUIs
(e.g. different toolkits) and performance - this could be better accomplished
with a common display manager that allows these differences.
t have a well-defined greeter API allowing multiple GUIs Support for all
display manager use cases, with plugins where appropriate Low code complexity
Fast performance
