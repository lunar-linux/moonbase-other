cat <<EOF
LightDM is a cross-desktop display manager that aims is to be the
standard display manager for the X.org X server. The motivation for
this project is there have been many new display managers written since
XDM (often based on the XDM source). The main difference between these
projects is in the GUIs (e.g. different toolkits) and performance -
this could be better accomplished with a common display manager that
allows these differences.

Key features are:

A well-defined greeter API allowing multiple GUIs Support for all
display manager use cases, with plugins where appropriate Low code
complexity Fast performance
