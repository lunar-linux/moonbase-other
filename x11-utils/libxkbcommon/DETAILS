cat << EOF
xkbcommon is a library to handle keyboard descriptions, including loading them from disk, parsing 
them and handling their state. It's mainly meant for client toolkits, window systems, and other 
system applications; currently that includes Wayland, kmscon, GTK+, Qt, Clutter, and more. It is 
also used by some XCB applications for proper keyboard support.
