cat << EOF
xkbcommon is a library to handle keyboard descriptions, including loading them
from disk, parsing them and handling their state. It's mainly meant for client
toolkits, window systems, and other system applications; currently that includes
Wayland, kmscon, GTK+, Qt, Clutter, and more. It is also used by some XCB
applications for proper keyboard support.
