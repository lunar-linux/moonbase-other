Quote from the author: In my opinion, this program is a pile of crap
which gets crappier with every patch, but it is also sooo useful ;*)
It's purpose is to display logfiles in different colours on your
root-window. That is, it works just like tail -f.

This version (1.2 and up) is a patched version of the abandoned old code.
