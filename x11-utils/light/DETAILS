Light is a program to control backlights and other lights under GNU/Linux:
- Works where other software has proven unreliable (xbacklight etc.)
- Works even in a fully CLI-environment, i.e. it does not rely on X
- Provides functionality to automatically control backlights with the highest
  precision available
- Extra features, like setting a minimum brightness value for controllers, or
  saving/restoring the value for poweroffs/boots.
