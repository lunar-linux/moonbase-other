Xrestop uses the X-Resource extension to provide 'top' like statistics
of each connected X11 client's server side resource usage. It is
intended as a developer tool to aid more efficient server resource
usage and debug server side leakage.

It should work with any server supporting the X-Resource extension
(X.Org server and XFree86 4.3+, 'xdpyinfo|grep Resource' should tell
you if your server has it).
