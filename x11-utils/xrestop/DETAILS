cat << EOF
Xrestop uses the X-Resource extension to provide 'top' like statistics 
of each connected X11 client's server side resource usage. It is 
intended as a developer tool to aid more efficient server resource 
usage and debug server side leakage. 

It should work with any server supporting the X-Resource extension 
(X.Org server and XFree86 4.3+, 'xdpyinfo|grep Resource' should tell 
you if your server has it).
