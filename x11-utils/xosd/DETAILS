XOSD displays text on your screen, sounds simple right?
The difference is it is unmanaged and shaped, so it appears transparent.
This gives the effect of an On Screen Display, like your TV/VCR etc.
The package also includes an xmms plugin, which automatically displays
various interesting things as they change (song name, volume etc...).
