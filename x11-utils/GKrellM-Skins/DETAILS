A theme is a directory in one of the locations: ~/.gkrellm2/themes 
or /usr/share/gkrellm2/themes. If a "gkrellmrc" file exists in a 
theme directory, it is parsed for theme specific settings such as 
borders, margins, colors, and krell parameters.
The theme directory also has images for the frame, background images 
for each of the drawing areas, and detail images (decals and krells) 
which are drawn on panel and meter areas.
