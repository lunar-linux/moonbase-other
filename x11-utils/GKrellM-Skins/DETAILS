A theme is a directory in one of the locations: ~/.gkrellm2/themes
or /usr/share/gkrellm2/themes. If a "gkrellmrc" file exists in a
theme directory, it is parsed for theme specific settings such as
borders, margins, colors, and krell parameters.
The theme directory also has images for the frame, background images
for each of the drawing areas, and detail images (decals and krells)
which are drawn on panel and meter areas.
