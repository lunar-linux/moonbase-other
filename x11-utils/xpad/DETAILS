xpad is a sticky note application written using GTK+ 2.0 that strives
to be simple, fault-tolerant, and customizable.  xpad consists of 
independent pad windows; each is basically a text box in which notes 
can be written.  Despite being called xpad, all that is needed to 
run or compile it is the GTK+ 2.0 libraries.
