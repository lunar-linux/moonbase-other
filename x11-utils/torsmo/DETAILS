Torsmo is a system monitor that sits in the corner of your desktop.
It's very simple, customizable and it renders only text on the
desktop (and percentagebars if you want it to ;) and the only lib
it uses is Xlib.

Torsmo can show various information about your system and it's
peripherals, including things like the Kernel version, Uptime,
System time, etc. etc.
