Directory administrator is a smart LDAP directory management tool. It can
be used to manage UNIX users and groups in a single sign-on setup, corporate
address book information, host-based access control and advanced mail
routing. It's extremely easy to install and use, yet powerful at the same
time. Along with popular software, it's the preferred solution for single
sign-on solution maintenance.
