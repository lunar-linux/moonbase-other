screenFetch is a "Bash Screenshot Information Tool". This handy Bash script
can be used to generate one of those nifty terminal theme information + ASCII
distribution logos you see in everyone's screenshots nowadays. It will auto-
detect your distribution and display an ASCII version of that distribution's
logo and some valuable information to the right. There are options to specify
no ASCII art, colors, taking a screenshot upon displaying info, and even
customizing the screenshot command!
This script is very easy to add to and can easily be extended.
