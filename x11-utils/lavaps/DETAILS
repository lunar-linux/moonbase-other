cat << EOF
LavaPS is an interactive process-tracking program like ``top'', but with
a much different attitude. Rather than presenting lots of specific info
in digital form, it tries to present certain important information in a
graphical analog form. The idea is that you can run it in the background
and get a rough idea of what's happening to your system without devoting
much concentration to the task.
