This is a collection of simple PIN or passphrase entry dialogs which
utilize the Assuan protocol as described by the aegypten project; see
http://www.gnupg.org/aegypten/ for details.

There are programs for different toolkits available.  For all GUIs it
is automatically detected which modules can be built, but it can also
be requested explicitely.
