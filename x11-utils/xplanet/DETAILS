cat << EOF
Xplanet was inspired by Xearth, which renders an image of the earth into
the X root window. Azimuthal, Mercator, Mollweide, orthographic, or
rectangular projections can be shown as well as a window with a globe the
user can rotate interactively using OpenGL or Mesa. The other planets and
some satellites may also be displayed.
