Hot-babe is a small graphical utility which display the system activity in
a very special way. When the CPU is idle, it displays a dressed girl, and
when the activity goes up, as the temperature increases, the girl begins
to undress, to finish totally naked when the system activity reaches 100%.
Of course, if you can be shocked by nudity, don't use it!
