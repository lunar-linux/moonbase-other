Hot-babe is a small graphical utility which display the system activity in 
a very special way. When the CPU is idle, it displays a dressed girl, and 
when the activity goes up, as the temperature increases, the girl begins 
to undress, to finish totally naked when the system activity reaches 100%. 
Of course, if you can be shocked by nudity, don't use it!
