Synergy lets you easily share a single mouse and keyboard between 
multiple computers with different operating systems, each with its 
own display, without special hardware. It's intended for users with 
multiple computers on their desk since each system uses its own 
monitor(s).
Redirecting the mouse and keyboard is as simple as moving the mouse 
off the edge of your screen. Synergy also merges the clipboards of 
all the systems into one, allowing cut-and-paste between systems. 
Furthermore, it synchronizes screen savers so they all start and stop 
together and, if screen locking is enabled, only one screen requires a 
password to unlock them all.
