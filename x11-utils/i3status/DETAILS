cat <<EOF
i3status is a small program for generating a status bar for i3bar,
dzen2, xmobar or similar programs. It is designed to be very efficient
by issuing a very small number of system calls, as one generally wants
to update such a status line every second. This ensures that even under
high load, your status bar is updated correctly. Also, it saves a bit of
energy by not hogging your CPU as much as spawning the corresponding
amount of shell commands would.
