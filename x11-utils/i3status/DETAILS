i3status is a small program for generating a status bar for i3bar,
dzen2, xmobar or similar programs. It is designed to be very efficient
by issuing a very small number of system calls, as one generally
wants to update such a status line every second.  This ensures that
even under high load, your status bar is updated correctly.  Also, it
saves a bit of energy by not hogging your CPU as much as spawning the
corresponding amount of shell commands would.
