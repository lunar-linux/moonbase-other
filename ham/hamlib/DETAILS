The Ham Radio Control Libraries, Hamlib for short, is a development effort to
provide a consistent interface for programmers wanting to incorporate radio
control in their programs. Hamlib is not a complete user application, rather,
it is a software layer intended to make controlling various radios and other
shack hardware much easier. Hamlib will allow authors of such software as
logging programs, digital communications programs, or those wanting to develop
the ultimate radio control software to concentrate on the user interface and
the basic function of the program rather than radio control.
