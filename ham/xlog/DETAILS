Xlog will display a log with the most recent contacts added to the top.
You can add, delete and edit log entries. The log is saved into a text
file.  When clicking on the log column called "Call", you can sort the
log either ascending, descending or by entry.  Xlog is able to do DXCC
lookups and will display country information, CQ and ITU zone, location
in latitude and longitude and distance and heading in kilometers or
miles, both for short and long path.
