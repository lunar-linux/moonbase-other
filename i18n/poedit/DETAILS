cat << EOF
poEdit is cross-platform gettext catalogs (.po files) editor. It 
is built with wxWidgets toolkit and can run on any platform 
supported by it (although it was only tested on Unix with GTK+ 
and Windows). It aims to provide more convenient approach to 
editing catalogs than launching vi and editing the file by hand.
