cat << EOF
Lua is a powerful light-weight programming language designed
for extending applications. Lua is also frequently used as a
general-purpose, stand-alone language. Lua is free software.

Lua is a language engine that you can embed into your application. This
means that, besides syntax and semantics, Lua has an API that allows
the application to exchange data with Lua programs and also to extend
Lua with C functions. In this sense, Lua can be regarded as a language
framework for building domain-specific languages.
