cat << EOF
This is based on Bruce Evans's C compiler with additional code,
including a reasonable C library for ELKS DOS or standalone,
written by myself and others.

This is the source mainly for use with Linux i386 but should work
with other unix versions. Within Linux the assembler and linker
are used for bootblocks, DOSEMU and other packages.

Includes bcc, as86 and more.
