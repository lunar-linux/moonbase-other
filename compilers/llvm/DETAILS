LLVM is a robust system, particularly well suited for developing new 
mid-level language-independent analyses and optimizations of all sorts, 
including those that require extensive interprocedural analysis. LLVM is 
also a great target for front-end development for conventional or research 
programming languages, including those which require compile-time, 
link-time, or run-time optimization for effective implementation, proper 
tail calls or garbage collection.

Clang is a compiler front-end for the C family of languages (C, C++, 
Objective-C, and Objective-C++) which can be built as a part of the 
LLVM compiler intrastructure project.
