LLVM is a robust system, particularly well suited for developing new
mid-level language-independent analyses and optimizations of all sorts,
including those that require extensive interprocedural analysis. LLVM is
also a great target for front-end development for conventional or research
programming languages, including those which require compile-time,
link-time, or run-time optimization for effective implementation, proper
tail calls or garbage collection.

Clang is a compiler front-end for the C family of languages (C, C++,
Objective-C, and Objective-C++) which can be built as a part of the
LLVM compiler intrastructure project.
