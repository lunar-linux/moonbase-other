Owl Lisp is a functional dialect of the Scheme programming language.
It is mainly based on the applicative subset of the R7RS standard. Owl can be
used either interactively, or to interpret code from files, or compile programs
to fasl-images or c-files. The difference between an owl program and a plain
script is that the program should just have a function of one argument as the
last value, which will be called with the command line argument list when the
program is executed.
