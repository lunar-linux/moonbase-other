Jikes is a compiler that translates Java source files as defined in
The Java Language Specification into the bytecoded instruction set
and binary format defined in The Java Virtual Machine Specification.

You may wonder why the world needs another Java compiler, considering
that Sun provides javac free with its SDK. Jikes has five advantages
that make it a valuable contribution to the Java community:

  * Open source. Jikes is OSI Certified Open Source Software. OSI
  Certified is a certification mark of the Open Source Initiative.

  * Strictly Java compatible. Jikes strives to adhere to both The Java
  Language Specification and The Java Virtual Machine Specification
  as tightly as possible, and does not support subsets, supersets,
  or other variations of the language. The FAQ describes some of the
  side effects of this strict language conformance.

  * High performance. Jikes is a high performance compiler, making it
  ideal for use with larger projects.

  * Dependency analysis. Jikes performs a dependency analysis on your
  code that provides two very useful features: Incremental builds and
  makefile generation.

  * Constructive Assistance. Jikes strives to help the programmer
  write better code in two key ways. Jikes has always strived to
  provide clear error and warning text to assist the programmer in
  understanding problems, and now with release 1.19 Jikes helps point
  out common programming mistakes as documented in Effective Java.
