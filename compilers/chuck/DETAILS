cat << EOF
ChucK is a new (and developing) audio programming language for real-time
synthesis, composition, performance, and now, analysis. It presents
a new time-based, concurrent programming model that's highly precise and
expressive (we call this strongly-timed), as well as dynamic control
rates, and the ability to add and modify code on-the-fly.
