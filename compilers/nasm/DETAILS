NASM is an 80x86 assembler designed for portability and modularity. It supports
a range of object file formats including Linux a.out and ELF, COFF, Microsoft
16-bit OBJ and Win32. It will also output plain binary files. Its syntax is
designed to be simple and easy to understand, similar to Intel's but less 
complex. It supports Pentium, P6, MMX, 3DNow! and SSE opcodes, and has macro
capability. It includes a disassembler as well. Now with full 64-bit
(x86-64/x64/AMD64/Intel 64) architecture and object file support.
