cat <<EOF
SpiderMonkey 1.8.5 includes a just-in-time compiler (JIT) (several, actually)
that compiles JavaScript to machine code, for a significant speed increase.
It is supported only on x86, x86_64 and ARM architectures. On other platforms,
the JIT is simply disabled; JavaScript code runs in an interpreter, as in
previous versions. It's the same language, just not as fast.
