cat << EOF
Lua is a powerful light-weight programming language designed for extending
applications. Lua is also frequently used as a general-purpose, stand-alone
language. Lua is free software.

Lua is a language engine that you can embed into your application. This means
that, besides syntax and semantics, Lua has an API that allows the application
to exchange data with Lua programs and also to extend Lua with C functions. In
this sense, Lua can be regarded as a language framework for building
domain-specific languages.
