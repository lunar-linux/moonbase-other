cat << EOF
Suhosin is an advanced protection system for PHP installations. It was designed
to protect servers and users from known and unknown flaws in PHP applications
and the PHP core. Suhosin comes in two independent parts, that can be used
separately or in combination. The first part is a small patch against the PHP
core, that implements a few low-level protections against bufferoverflows or
format string vulnerabilities and the second part is a powerful PHP extension
that implements all the other protections.
