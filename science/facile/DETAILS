FaCiLe is a constraint programming library on integer and integer set
finite domains written in OCaml. It offers all usual facilities to
create and manipulate finite domain variables, arithmetic expressions
and constraints (possibly non-linear), built-in global constraints
(difference, cardinality, sorting etc.) and search and optimization
goals.
FaCiLe allows as well to build easily user-defined constraints and goals
(including recursive ones), making pervasive use of OCaml higher-order
functionals to provide a simple and flexible interface for the user. As
FaCiLe is an OCaml library and not "yet another language", the user
benefits from type inference and strong typing discipline, high level of
abstraction, modules and objects system, as well as native code
compilation efficiency, garbage collection and replay debugger, all
features of OCaml (among many others) that allow to prototype and
experiment quickly: modeling, data processing and interface are
implemented with the same powerful and efficient language.
