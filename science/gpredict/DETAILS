Gpredict is a real-time satellite tracking and orbit prediction application.
It can track an unlimited number of satellites and display their position
and other data in lists, tables, maps, and polar plots (radar view). Gpredict
can also predict the time of future passes for a satellite, and provide you
with detailed information about each pass.
