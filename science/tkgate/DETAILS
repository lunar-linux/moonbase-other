TkGate is a event driven digital circuit simulator with a tcl/tk-based
graphical editor. TkGate supports a wide range of primitive circuit
elements as well as user-defined modules for hierarchical design. The
distribution comes with a number of tutorial and example circuits which
can be loaded through the "Help" menu. The example circuits include a
simple CPU, programmed to run the Animals game. For more information,
check out the documentation. TkGate is free software provided with source
