Genius is a general-purpose calculator program similiar in some aspects
to BC, Matlab, Maple or Mathematica. It is useful both as a simple
calculator and as a research or educational tool. The syntax is very
intuitive, and is designed to mimic how mathematics is usually written.
GEL is the name of its extension language - it stands for Genius
Extension Language. In fact, many of the standard Genius functions are
written in GEL itself.
