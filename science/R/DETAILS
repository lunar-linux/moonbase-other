R is a GNU project which is similar to the S language and environment which
was developed at Bell Laboratories (formerly AT&T, now LucentiTechnologies)
by John Chambers and colleagues. R can be considered as a different
implementation of S. There are some important differences, but much code
written for S runs unaltered under R.

R provides a wide variety of statistical (linear and nonlinear modeling,
classical statistical tests, time-series analysis, classification, clustering,
...) and graphical techniques, and is highly extensible. The S language is
often the vehicle of choice for research in statistical methodology, and R
provides an Open Source route to participation in that activity.
