Here is a list of programs that are part of gEDA/gaf (gschem and friends):

 * gschem is the schematic capture program/tool which is part of gEDA. It's 
   sole purpose is to facilitate the graphical input of components/circuits.

 * gnetlist is a netlist generation program. It takes as input gEDA/gaf .sch 
   (schematic) file and the required .sym (symbol) files and converts them into
   netlists.

 * gattrib is gEDA?s attribute editor. It reads a set of gschem .sch files 
   (schematic files), and creates a spreadsheet showing all components in rows, 
   with the associated component attributes listed in the columns.

 * symbols (on a schematic) are an abstract representation of the physical 
   components used in electronic circuits.

 * There are many utilities included as part of gEDA/gaf.

 * gsymcheck is the symbol checker for the gEDA/gaf system. Give it a symbol 
   file and it will go through and verify that the symbol will work in gschem
   and friends.
