It reads a set of gschem .sch files (schematic files), and creates a
spreadsheet showing all components in rows, with the associated component
attributes listed in the columns. It allows the user to add, modify, or
delete component attributes outside of gschem, and then save the .sch files
back out. When it is completed, it will allow the user to edit attributes
attached to components, nets, and pins. (Currently, only component attribute
editing is implemented; pin attributes are displayed only, and net attributes
are TBD.)
