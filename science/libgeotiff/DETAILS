libgeotiff is a library (normally built on top of libtiff) for reading
and writing coordinate system information from/to GeoTIFF files. It
includes CSV files for expanding projected coordinate system codes into
full projections, and definitions and examples of transforming the
definitions into a form that can be used with the PROJ.4 projections
library. It also includes the sample applications.
