'libgeotiff' is a library (normally built on top of libtiff) for reading and
writing coordinate system information from/to GeoTIFF files. It includes
CSV files for expanding projected coordinate system codes into full projections,
and definitions and examples of transforming the definitions into a form that 
can be used with the PROJ.4 projections library. It also includes the sample 
applications.
