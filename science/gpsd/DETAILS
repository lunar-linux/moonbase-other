cat << EOF
gpsd is a service daemon that monitors one or more GPSes attached
to a host computer through serial or USB ports, making all data on
the location/course/velocity of the sensors available to be queried
on TCP port 2947 of the host computer. With gpsd, multiple GPS client
applications (such as navigational and wardriving software) can share
access to GPSes without contention or loss of data. Also, gpsd responds
to queries with a format that is substantially easier to parse than
the NMEA 0183 emitted by most GPSes. The gpsd distribution includes a
linkable C service library, a C++ wrapper class, and a Python module
that developers of gpsd-aware applications can use to encapsulate all
communication with gpsd.
