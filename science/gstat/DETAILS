cat << EOF
Gtat is an open source (GPL) computer code for multivariable 
geostatistical modelling, prediction and simulation, and has been 
around from 1997. In the original form, gstat is a stand-alone 
executable, interfaced to various GIS. As of 2003, the gstat 
functionaly is also available as an S extension, either as R package 
or S-Plus library. Current development mainly focuses on the S 
extension. The reason for this is obvious for those familiar with R 
and/or S-Plus.
