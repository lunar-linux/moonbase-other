Gtat is an open source (GPL) computer code for multivariable
geostatistical modelling, prediction and simulation, and has been
around from 1997. In the original form, gstat is a stand-alone
executable, interfaced to various GIS. As of 2003, the gstat
functionaly is also available as an S extension, either as R package
or S-Plus library. Current development mainly focuses on the S
extension. The reason for this is obvious for those familiar with R
and/or S-Plus.
