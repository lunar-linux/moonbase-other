ParaView is an open-source, multi-platform data analysis and visualization 
application. ParaView users can quickly build visualizations to analyze their 
data using qualitative and quantitative techniques. The data exploration can be
done interactively in 3D or programmatically using ParaView's batch processing 
capabilities.

ParaView was developed to analyze extremely large datasets using distributed 
memory computing resources. It can be run on supercomputers to analyze datasets 
of terascale as well as on laptops for smaller data.
