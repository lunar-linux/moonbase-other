is a translator library for raster geospatial data formats that is released 
under an X/MIT style Open Source license. As a library, it presents a
single abstract data model to the calling application for all supported 
formats. The related OGR library (which lives within the GDAL source tree)
provides a similar capability for simple features vector data.
