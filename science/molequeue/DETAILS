MoleQueue is an open-source, cross-platform, system-tray resident desktop application
for abstracting, managing, and coordinating the execution of tasks both locally and
on remote computational resources. It is built and tested and Linux, Mac OS X, and
Windows, with nightly binaries currently available for Mac OS X and Windows.

Users can set up local and remote queues that describe where the task will be executed.
Each queue can have programs, with templates to facilitate the execution of the program.
Input files can be staged, and output files collected using a standard interface.
