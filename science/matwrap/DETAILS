cat << EOF
Matwrap is a tool for interfacing C++ code into matrix-oriented scripting
languages such as Matlab 5, Octave, and tela. It generates all the code
to convert from the scripting language's internal types into the types
that your C++ code understands (e.g., double, char *, float *, struct
abc *). You do not need to understand any of the API details of the
language to use your C++ code; just give matwrap a .h file describing
your functions.

 Brief list of features:
Functions are automatically vectorized.

Arguments containing dimensions of other vector and matrix arguments can be
computed automatically and need not be specified.

Pointers to structures and classes are supported. Public member functions of
classes may be called, and public data members may be evaluated or set.

Inheritance is supported.
