GMT is an open source collection of ~60 tools for manipulating geographic and
Cartesian data sets (including filtering, trend fitting, gridding, projecting,
etc.) and producing Encapsulated PostScript File (EPS) illustrations ranging
from simple x-y plots via contour maps to artificially illuminated surfaces and
3-D perspective views. GMT supports ~30 map projections and transformations and
comes with support data such as GSHHS coastlines, rivers, and political
boundaries.
