The ATLAS (Automatically Tuned Linear Algebra Software) project is an ongoing 
research effort focusing on applying empirical techniques in order to provide 
portable performance. At present, it provides C and Fortran77 interfaces to a 
portably efficient BLAS implementation, as well as a few routines from LAPACK.
