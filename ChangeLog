2004-02-15 05:12  nhudson

	* web/mozilla/: BUILD, POST_INSTALL: 
	OMG!! I cant believe I didnt see this 3 days ago.  FInally I think
	we have a good NSS install.  I am testing it now to see.  Also I
	cleaned up the POST_INSTALL file a bit.  Some of the stuff in there
	is no longer needed.

2004-02-15 04:10  tchan

	* net/ntp/: BUILD, DETAILS: Added a patch to get ntp-4.2.0 to

	after the system includes.

	Ok here we go, I have taken away the SOURCE3 being that its old and
	not needed anymore due to the svg moz stuff will actually compile
	now.  Also not patching the Makefile anymore as that is old also. 
	So far looks like this way works best to get Moz NSS to compile. 
	Ccache is a very bad boy.

	* web/amaya/: BUILD, DEPENDS, DETAILS: Version bump to 8.2. 
	Removed the gtk+ optional_depends as this already depends on
	openMotif.  The old DEPENDS file would not correctly build amaya as
	an openMotif app.  Fixed the BUILD script to correctly build this
	as an openMotif app and to use the system libs for jpeg, libpng,
	and zlib.  The Redland (RDF) source code is now included in the
	amaya download but to get that extra lib/app to build from inside
	the amaya BUILD script was not something I wanted to tackle at this
	time.  If there are any Amaya users that need RDF enabled, please
	feel free to fix this module to compile/include those features.

	* video/MPlayer/CONFIGURE: The build of mencoder was breaking the
	compile of MPlayer on my machine with a 2.6.2-rc2 kernel. Since
	most people don't use mencoder, I made it an option that you can
	disable in the configure process.  The new --disable-mencoder
	configure flag has been tested and works just fine.

	and tested with gcc-3.2.3, kernel headers 2.4.x.  Should compile
	just fine under gcc-3.3.2.  Added the elfutils module to
	moonbase/devel to get this version of rpm to compile correctly. 
	Source is not distributed as tar.gz from RedHat, so I rpmunpack'd a
	src.rpm and put it into /var/spool/lunar on dbguin.  Same for
	elfutils module.

2004-02-08 04:25  tchan

	* perl/perl/POST_INSTALL: Added this because when Perl changes
	versions, the site specific perl modules tend to get lost. 
	Moonbase modules that add their own perl modules to /usr/lib/perl
	need a recompile to ensure proper function.  irssi, ImageMagick,
	SDL_perl are all that I could find at the moment.  I'm sure this
	list will need expanding.
