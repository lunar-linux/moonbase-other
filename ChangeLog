2003-04-28 11:33  sofar

	* libs/glib/: BUILD, DETAILS: Lots of gtk+ apps still break due to
	the upgrade of gettext. Analogous to glib-2 including -lintl (which
	fixes all gtk+-2 apps that break due to the gettext upgrade),
	having glib adding -lintl to glib-config fixes pretty much all the
	gtk+ apps that do not include -lintl somehow. This fix is the
	nicest one I could come up with, and should not interfere with
	stuff.
	
	Note that non-glib-[1|2] apps breaking on gettext don't see this
	fix (hence the wget patch before).
