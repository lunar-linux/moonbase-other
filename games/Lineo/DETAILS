Lineo is a 2 players game. To win, a player has to line up
4 pieces having at least one resemblance. The player who starts
the game is chosen randomly. He begins to play by chosing a
piece for the other player. The other player places the piece
on a free place on the board, and chooses another piece
for the first player to place.
