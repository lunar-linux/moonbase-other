The Black Cauldron end scene Sarien is an open source, portable
implementation of the Sierra On-Line Adventure Game Interpreter (AGI).
It is currently under development; no production-quality packages have
been released.  Sarien is able to execute Sierra On-Line AGI games at
different levels of playability.  Leisure Suit Larry, King's Quest II
and Mixed-Up Mother Gooose are some of the games that have been played
from beginning to end with Sarien.
