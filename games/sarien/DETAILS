The Black Cauldron end scene Sarien is an open source, portable implementation of the Sierra On-Line Adventure Game Interpreter (AGI). It is currently under development; no production-quality packages have been released. Sarien is able to execute Sierra On-Line AGI games at different levels of playability. Leisure Suit Larry, King's Quest II and Mixed-Up Mother Gooose are some of the games that have been played from beginning to end with Sarien.
