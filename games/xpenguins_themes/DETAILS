Most of the default penguin images were taken from the Pingus game. 
The xpenguins package includes the themes Penguins, Big Penguins, Classic 
Penguins, Turtles and Bill. The xpenguins_themes package contains the extra 
themes The Simpsons, Sonic the Hedgehog, Lemmings and Winnie the Pooh 
(distributed separately because the license/copyright situation is unclear).
