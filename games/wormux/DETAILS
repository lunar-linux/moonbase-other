Wormux is free software clone of the Worms game concept. Though
currently under heavy development, it is already very playable, with
lots of weapons (Dynamite, Baseball Bat, Teleportation, etc.). There
are also lots of maps available for your battling pleasure! Wormux
takes the genre to the next level, with great customisation options
leading to great gameplay. There is a wide selection of teams, from
the Aliens to the Chickens. Also, new battlefields can be downloaded
from the Internet, making strategy an important part of each battle.
