Xscorch is a clone of the classic DOS game, "Scorched Earth". 
The basic goal is to annihilate enemy tanks using overpowered guns. 
Basically, you buy weapons, you target the enemy by adjusting the 
angle of your turret and firing power, and you hope to destroy their 
tank before they destroy yours.
