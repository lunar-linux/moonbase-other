Dink Smallwood is an adventure/role-playing game, similar to Zelda
(2D top view), made by RTsoft.

The game features the twisted adventure of young Dink Smallwood,
a pig farmer who leaves his town and goes on a quest to save the world.

GNU FreeDink is a new and portable version of the game engine, which
runs the original game as well as its D-Mods, with close compatibility,
under multiple platforms.
