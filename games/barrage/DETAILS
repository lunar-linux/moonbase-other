Barrage is a rather violent action game with the objective to kill and
destroy as many targets as possible within 3 minutes. You control a
gun that may either fire small or large grenades at soldiers, jeeps and
tanks. Targets are fast paced and require careful aiming as it takes
half a second to reload the gun. Additionally you have to keep an eye
on your ammo and reload in time.
