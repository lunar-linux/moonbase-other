With over 30 levels, seven modes of play, loads of mutators, built-in bots,
11 player characters, 9 weapons(with alt-fire modes), the game has an endless
supply of replayability.

Using the CRX engine, which is based on the Id GPL source code, AA2K7 now
includes modern effects such as real time vertex lighting and shadows,
lensflares, light blooms, reflective water, textured particles, stainmaps, 32
bit color,  shaders, fog, and much more.

Built into the game is a easy to use server browser which allows the user to
query information about each server.  CRX features rewards systems, as well as
colored player names, winner podiums, and weapons stats.  The best thing about
the CRX engine however, is it's netcode and speed.  Even on a modest system,
you will get excellent framerates, and movement is still extremely smooth and
fast, even on high ping servers
