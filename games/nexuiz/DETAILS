Nexuiz has been in development for 3.5 years by a team of amateur
developers led by Lee Vermeulen. It is a 3D deathmatch game made
entirely over the internet. The purpose of the game is to bring
deathmatch back to the basics, with perfect weapon balancing and fast-
paced action, keeping itself away from the current trend of realistic
shooters. It uses HFX textures by Evil Lair, and currently has 17
maps to frag in. With an advanced UI, the user can select between 15
different player models to use, with an average of two skins for each,
and can connect to our master server to play people from all over
the world.

The game's content and source are GPL. Meaning, it is entirely free and
any of it can be used in other free projects, even if modified. This
is a first for any large game project of its type. We hope this will
support the free game community, and encourage more GPL projects.

Nexuiz is based on the Darkplaces engine. The darkplaces engine is an
advanced Quake 1 engine developed mainly by Forest "LordHavoc" Hale,
who has been working with the Quake 1 engine for many years. A few of
Darkplaces' main features are Quake3bsp support, real-time lighting and
shadowing, new particle effects, advanced menu system, and Md3/Md2 model
support. Because Nexuiz is based on the Quake 1 engine, its source code
along with its content is entirely GPL. Nexuiz will also use the Quake 1
game code language, called QuakeC, which makes modding the gameplay
of the game extremely easy. This gamecode will be included with the
release, and will allow anyone to mod it, and because it is entirely
serverside you can use it on your servers even if the clients do not
have your mod.

Nexuiz will not require a high-end system. Video cards such as a
Geforce 1 will be able to run Nexuiz, while high-end video cards will
be able to take advantage of some features such as real-time lighting
and bump-mapping.
