cat << EOF
Vectoroids is based on the X-Window PDA game 'Agendaroids,' but uses
libSDL for graphics, sound, and input, and includes nicer graphics,
sound effects, and music. The objective is to survive wave after wave 
of giant rocks, which you must shoot to break into smaller pieces,
until they are completely destroyed.
