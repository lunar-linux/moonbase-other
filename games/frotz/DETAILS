From the Frotz website:

Frotz is an interpreter for Infocom games and other Z-machine games.
It complies with standard 1.0 of Graham Nelson's specification. It
was written by Stefan Jokisch in 1995-1997. It was ported to Unix by
Galen Hazelwood. Currently the Unix port is being developed and
maintained by David Griffith. The Unix port is also the canonical core
version upon which all other ports are based.
