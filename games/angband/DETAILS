Angband is a freeware computer dungeon exploration game based (loosely)
on the books of J.R.R.Tolkien. You explore a very deep dungeon, kill
monsters, try to equip yourself with the best weapons and armor you can\
find, and finally face Morgoth - "The Dark Enemy."

Angband has a very long history. It started 1990 as an improved and
"Tolkienized" variant of Moria. Moria itself was created in 1985 and was
inspired by Rogue (from the late 70s). Countless changes were introduced
by many programmers on the way to the current versions of Angband.
