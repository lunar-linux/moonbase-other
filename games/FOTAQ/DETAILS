A game for scummvm, the freeware version of Flight of the Amazon Queen
(Talkie).

You assume the role of Joe King, a pilot for hire who is given the job of 
flying Faye Russell (a famous movie star) into the Amazon jungle for a photo 
shoot. Of course, things never go according to plans. After an unfortunate 
turn of events they find themselves stranded in the heart of the Amazon 
jungle, where Joe will embark on a quest to rescue a kidnapped princess 
and in the process, discover the true sinister intentions of a suspiciously 
located Lederhosen company. In a rich 2D environment, Joe will cross paths 
with a variety of unlikely jungle inhabitants including, but not limited to, 
a tribe of Amazon women and 6-foot-tall pygmies.
