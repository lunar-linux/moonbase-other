A game for scummvm, the freeware version of Flight of the Amazon Queen
(Talkie).

You assume the role of Joe King, a pilot for hire who is given the job
of flying Faye Russell (a famous movie star) into the Amazon jungle for
a photo-shoot. Of course, things never go according to plan. After an
unfortunate turn of events, they find themselves stranded in the heart
of the Amazon jungle, where Joe will embark on a quest to rescue a
kidnapped princess, and in the process, discover the true sinister
intentions of a suspiciously-located Lederhosen company. In a rich 2D
environment, Joe will cross paths with a variety of unlikely jungle
inhabitants, including a tribe of Amazon women and 6-foot-tall pygmies.
