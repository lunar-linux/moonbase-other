cat << EOF
Trackballs is a marble game inspired by the 80's Atari classic Marble
Madness.

By steering a marble ball through a labyrinth filled with swinging
hammers, pools of slime,  and other obstacles the player collects points.
When the destination is reached you continue  on to the next, more
difficult level. - unless the time runs out.  

Unlike marble madness the game uses 3D graphics even though the original
game had no real use for it. Also the game is fully programmable with a
scripting extension (Guile), and includes a level editor with which to
easily create new levels.
