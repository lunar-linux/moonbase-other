Trackballs is a simple game similar to the classical game Marble Madness
on the Amiga in the 80's. By steering a marble ball through a labyrinth
filled with vicious hammers, pools of acid and other obstacles the player
collects points. When the ball reaches the destination it continues to
the next, more difficult track - unless the time runs out.
