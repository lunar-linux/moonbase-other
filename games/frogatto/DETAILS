# Description from http://freshmeat.net/projects/frogatto
cat << EOF
Frogatto is an old-school 2D platformer game starring a certain
quixotic frog. It has gorgeous, high-end pixel art, pumping arcade
tunes, and all the gameplay nuance of a classic console title. Run and
jump over pits and enemies. Grab enemies with your tongue, swallow
them, and then spit them out at other enemies as projectiles! Fight
dangerous bosses, and solve vexing puzzles. Collect coins and use them
to buy upgrades and new abilities in the store. Talk to characters in-
game, and work to unravel Big Bad Milgram's plot against the townsfolk!

At over 30 levels set in 4 different environments, Frogatto is not a
flash in the pan, and has the playing time you'd expect from a real
video game.
