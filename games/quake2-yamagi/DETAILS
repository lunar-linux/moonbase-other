This is an enhanced client for iD Software's legendary Quake II. It
focuses on single-player gaming and co-operative gaming, rather than
classic multiplayer. This client is based upon Icculus Quake II, but
has a vast amount of improvements. Hundreds of type errors were fixed,
and a lot of bugs in gameplay. Some broken features were repaired, and
some map quirks added.
