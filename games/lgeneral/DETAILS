cat << EOF
LGeneral is a turn-based strategy engine heavily inspired by Panzer General.
You play single scenarios or whole campaigns turn by turn against a human
player or the AI. Entrenchment, rugged defense, defensive fire, surprise
contacts, surrender, unit supply, weather influence, reinforcements and other
implementations contribute to the tactical and strategic depth of the game.
