Circus Linux! is a clone of the Atari 2600 game "Circus Atari," produced by
Atari, Inc. The object is to move a teeter-totter back and forth across the
screen to bounce clowns up into the air. When they reach the top, they pop
rows of balloons and then fall back down. If you don't catch one, you lose 
a clown!
