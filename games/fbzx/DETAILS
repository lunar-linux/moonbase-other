FBZX is a Sinclair Spectrum emulator, designed to work at full screen
using the FrameBuffer or under X-Windows. Its main features are:
 * Emulates accurately the original Spectrum (both issue 2 and issue 3),
   the classic 128K, the Amstrad Plus 2, the Amstrad Plus 2A and the
   Spanish 128K. This include screen, keyboard and sound (both speaker
   and AY-3-8912 chip).
 * Screen emulation is extremely accurate, so it can emulate border
   effects and even attribute effects.
 * Supports Z80 snapshots, both loading and saving, and loading .SNA
   snapshots.
 * Supports TAP (both read and write) and TZX (only read) tape files,
   supporting normal-speed loading and fast speed loading.
 * Emulates joysticks: Kempston, cursor and Sinclair.
 * Emulates the Interface I and Microdrive.
 * Based in a new, fully free, Z80 emulator (Z80Free).
 * Is distributed under GPLv3 license.
