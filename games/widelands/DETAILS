cat <<EOF
Widelands is an open source (GPLed) real-time strategy game. It is
built upon the SDL and other open source libraries and is (and will
always be) under heavy development. If you knew Settlers I & II(TM)
((C) Bluebyte), then you already have a rough idea what Widelands is
all about because widelands is heavily inspired by those two games.
