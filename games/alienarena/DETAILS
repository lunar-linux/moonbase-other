cat << EOF
With over 30 levels, seven modes of play, loads of mutators, built-in
bots, 11 player characters, 9 weapons (with alt-fire modes), the game
has an endless supply of replayability.

Using the CRX engine, which is based on the Id GPL source code, AA
now includes modern effects such as real-time vertex lighting and
shadows, lensflares, light blooms, reflective water, textured
particles, stainmaps, 32-bit color,  shaders, fog, and much more.

Has a "signal 11" startup error with NVIDIA-beta 190.36, so use e.g.
NVIDIA 185.18.36 instead.
