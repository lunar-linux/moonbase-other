With over 30 levels, seven modes of play, loads of mutators, built-in
bots, 11 player characters, 9 weapons (with alt-fire modes), the game

Using the CRX engine, which is based on the Id GPL source code, AA
now includes modern effects such as real-time vertex lighting and
shadows, lensflares, light blooms, reflective water, textured
particles, stainmaps, 32-bit color,  shaders, fog, and much more.
