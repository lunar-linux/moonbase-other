cat << EOF
LTris is a tetris clone which means you have a bowl with blocks falling
down. By rotating and moving the blocks, you try to assemble whole lines
which then disappear. LTris has three modes for this: Classic is the
classical one where you play until the bowl becomes filled, Figures
reset the bowl contents to a new figure for each level and adds
suddenly-appearing tiles and lines later on, and Multiplayer where up to
three players either controlled by humans or CPU(!) compete and send
completed lines to each other.
