cat << EOF
LTris as a tetris clone which means you have a bowl with blocks falling
down. By rotating and moving the blocks you try to assemble whole lines
which then disappear. LTris has three modes for this: Classic is the
classical one where you play until the bowl becomes filled, Figures
resets the bowl contents to a new figure for each level and adds
suddenly appearing tiles and lines later on and Multiplayer where up to
three players either controlled by human or CPU(!) compete and send
completed lines to each other.
