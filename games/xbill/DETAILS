XBill is an arcade style game for the X Window System. It was very popular
among Linux gamers at the end of the 1990s, beating out Quake, though not
Quake II, as Linux Journal reader's favourite Linux game in 1999.

Written by Brian Wellington and Matias Duarte,[2] the game features a
bespectacled character known as "Bill". The goal is to prevent Bill's
legions of clones from installing "Wingdows", a virus "cleverly designed
to resemble a popular operating system", on a variety of computers
running other operating systems.
