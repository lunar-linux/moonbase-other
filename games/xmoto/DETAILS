X-Moto is a challenging 2D motocross platform game, where physics play
an all-important role in the gameplay. You need to control your bike to
its limit, if you want to have a chance of finishing the more difficult
of the challenges.
First you'll try just to complete the levels, while later you'll
compete with yourself and others, racing against the clock.
