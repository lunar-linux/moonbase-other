FreedroidRPG is derived from the original classic Freedroid
based on the game paradroid from the commodore 64. In this game you
are Tux, one of a race sentient penguins. Humanity is in ruins due
to the evil MegaSoft corporation and their original plans to rule the
human race. An attempt to use their omnipresent software to take
over all droids, upon which humanity depended, backfired when the droids
themselves became self-aware and decided to put forth their own plans
for total domination. As Tux, it is your job to restore things to
their rightful place and undue the horrible, evil, and thouroughly
inhumane things initiated by this MS corporation.
