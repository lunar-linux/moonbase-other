NetHack is a single player dungeon exploration game that runs on a
wide variety of computer systems, with a variety of graphical and text
interfaces all using the same game engine. Unlike many other Dungeons &
Dragons-inspired games, the emphasis in NetHack is on discovering the
detail of the dungeon and not simply killing everything in sight - in
fact, killing everything in sight is a good way to die quickly. Each game
presents a different landscape - the random number generator provides
an essentially unlimited number of variations of the dungeon and its
denizens to be discovered by the player in one of a number of characters:
you can pick your race, your role, and your gender.
