Kobo Deluxe is a 3'rd person  scrolling 2d shooter with a simple
and responsive control system  - which you'll need to tackle the
tons of enemy ships that shoot at you,  chase you, circle around
you shooting,  or even  launch other ships at you,  while you're
trying to  destroy the  labyrinth  shaped  bases.  There  are 50
action packed  levels with  smoothly increasing  difficulty, and
different combinations of enemies that require different tactics
to be dealt with successfully.
