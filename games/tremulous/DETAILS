cat << EOF
Tremulous is a free, open-source game that blends a team-based FPS with
elements of an RTS. Players can choose from 2 unique races: aliens and
humans. Players on both teams are able to build working structures
in-game like an RTS. These structures provide many functions, the most
important being spawning. The designated builders must ensure there are
spawn structures, or other players will not be able to rejoin the game
after death. Other structures provide automated base defense (to some
degree), healing functions and much more... Player advancement is
different depending on which team you are on. As a human, players are
rewarded with credits for each alien kill. These credits may be used to
purchase new weapons and upgrades from the Armoury. The alien team
advances quite differently. Upon killing a human foe, the alien is able
to evolve into a new class. The more kills gained, the more powerful
the classes available. The overall objective behind Tremulous is to
eliminate the opposing team. This is achieved by not only killing the
opposing players, but also removing their ability to respawn by
destroying their spawn structures.
