DarkPlaces is a Quake modification I have built over the course of 6
years on and off experimenting, it got somewhat of an overhaul when the
Quake engine source code was released, and I began developing a custom
OpenGL-only engine for it and other mods, which supports Windows WGL and
Linux GLX, and has greatly-improved graphics and image quality.

It can not easily be described, as it is simply an improved Quake, not a
total conversion (yet, anyway).

The realism of shell casings falling to the floor, much improved bullet
impacts, 32bit color alpha blended explosions, blood flying everywhere
and sticking to the walls...

Behind the scenes the code has changed a great deal. I was not content
with the original QuakeC code, and I have greatly changed the engine
while maintaining compatibility with normal Quake modifications.
