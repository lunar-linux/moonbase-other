GGZ Gaming Zone is a way for people to play a variety of games across the
Internet with both human and computer opponents. Similar to other such
endeavors (by Microsoft and Yahoo), GGZ will support multiple rooms
where players can login and chat across a table while they play their
favorite games.

This package contains the server ggz.
