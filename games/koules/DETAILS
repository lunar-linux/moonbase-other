if you can read this you don't need glases or you have invalid browser ...
Somewhere in the galaxy Once upon a time the evil KOULES exhausted all
the resources of their home planet ...
Their emperor DARK APPLEPOLISHER deployed his brutal hyperspace commandos
to wipe out human civilization and claim Earth's resources for his ralms ...
The nations of Earth chose their best warriors to defend the planet ...
These champions were biologically mutated into special creatures.
Their entities were reduced to mere chests and eyes ...
These qualities allow them operate in enemies' domain ...
Your battle for a new world begins NOW ...
Your mission is to bounce all KOULES fighterss from your sector ...
Some of them are deserters 
The green ones give you acceleration
the blue ones give you more weight ...
Look out for mighty super-spherical megaheavy ultra green B_BALL
