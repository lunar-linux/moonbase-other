THE CLASSICAL FREEDROID: Freedroid is a clone of the classic game
"Paradroid" on Commodore 64 with some improvements and extensions to
the classic version.

In this game, you control a robot, depicted by a small white ball with
a few numbers within an interstellar spaceship consisting of several
decks connected by elevators.

The aim of the game is to destroy all enemy robots, depicted by small
black balls with a few numbers, by either shooting them or seizing
control over them by creating connections in a short subgame of
electric circuits.
