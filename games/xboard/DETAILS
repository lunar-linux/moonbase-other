XBoard is a graphical user interfaces for chess. They display a
chessboard on the screen, accept moves made with the mouse, and loads
and saves games in Portable Game Notation (PGN).  It serves as a
front-end for many different chess services, including:
 * Chess engines that will run on your machine and play a game against
   you or help you analyze, such as GNU Chess and Crafty.
 * Chess servers on the Internet, where you can connect to play chess
   with people from all over the world, watch other users play, or
   just hang out and chat.
 * Correspondence chess played by electronic mail. The CMail program
   automates the tasks of parsing email from your opponent, playing
   his moves out on your board, and mailing your reply move after
   you've chosen it.
