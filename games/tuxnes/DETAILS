TuxNES is based on Nestra, a great public-domain NES emulator by
Quor.  TuxNES adds many features not found in Nestra, and uses a more
collaborative development model. Enhancements to Nestra often find
their way into TuxNES.  Enhancements to TuxNES don't generally find
their way into Nestra due to licensing restrictions (since pieces of
TuxNES are generally copyrighted by their authors, and covered by the
GNU General Public License,) although similar changes by the same
authors sometimes find their way back into Nestra.
