cat << EOF
Cube 2: Sauerbraten is a free multiplayer/singleplayer first person 
shooter, built as a major redesign of the Cube FPS. Much like the 
original Cube, the aim of this game is not necessarily to produce the 
most features & eyecandy possible, but rather to allow map/geometry 
editing to be done dynamically in-game, to create fun gameplay and an 
elegant engine.
