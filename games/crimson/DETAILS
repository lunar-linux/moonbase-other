Crimson Fields is a tactical war game in the tradition of Battle Isle.
Two players command their units on a map of hexagons, trying to accomplish
mission objectives ranging from defending important locations to simply
destroying all enemy forces. Damaged units may be repaired or replaced
by new recruits, while victorious squadrons will improve their abilities
so they will be even more difficult to beat next time.
