message "Before you run OpenTTD, you need to put the game's datafiles into the
/usr/share/games/openttd/data subdirectory. 
You need the following files from the original version of TTD as 
OpenTTD makes use of the original TTD artwork.

List of the required files: sample.cat trg1r.grf trgcr.grf trghr.grf
trgir.grf trgtr.grf

(Alternatively you can use the TTD GRF files from the DOS version:
TRG1.GRF, TRGC.GRF, TRGH.GRF, TRGI.GRF, TRGT.GRF. A few minor graphical
glitches with the DOS graphics remain. E.g. the autorail button in the
rail toolbar doesn't look as nice as with the Windows graphics.)

If you want music you need to copy the gm/ folder from Windows TTD into
your /usr/share/games/openttd folder, not your data folder.
