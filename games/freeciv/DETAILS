Freeciv is a multiuser reimplementation for Unix/X of the famous Microprose 
game of Civilization. By default, the game is an improved Civ II, but this 
can be customized; modpacks for near-100% compatibility with Civ I and Civ II
are included. Multiuser gameplay is real-time: in each turn, all human 
players move concurrently. The game is designed to remain fairly playable 
even on poor network connections. Freeciv can also be played on standalone 
machines, and its AI players are a good challenge for beginners. The source 
code comes with the server, two X clients, and non-X clients for MS Windows 
and Amiga. Freeciv is released under the GNU General Public License. It is 
maintained by an international team of coders and enthusiasts, and is easily 
one of the most fun and addictive network games out there.
