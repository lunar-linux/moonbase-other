Freeciv is a multiuser reimplementation for Unix/X of the famous
Microprose game of Civilization. By default, the game is an improved
Civ II, but this can be customized; modpacks for near-100%
compatibility with Civ I and Civ II are included. Multiuser gameplay is
real-time: in each turn, all human players move concurrently. The game
is designed to remain fairly playable even on poor network connections.
Freeciv can also be played on standalone machines, and its AI players
are a good challenge for beginners. The source code comes with the
server, two X clients, and non-X clients for MS Windows and Amiga.
Freeciv is released under the GNU General Public License. It is
maintained by an international team of coders and enthusiasts, and is
easily one of the most fun and addictive network games out there.
