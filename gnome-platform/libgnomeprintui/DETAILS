gnome-print is a C-based API that implements the Postscript imaging
model. It is an actively developed project, and it is being used by
various GNOME applications. There are two extensions to the Postscript
imaging model supported by gnome-print: Alpha channel support and 
anti-aliasing. gnome-print includes a rasterizing engine that
transforms the requests into bitmaps for native drivers.
