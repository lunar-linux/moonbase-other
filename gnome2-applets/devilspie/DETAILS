cat << EOF
A window-matching utility, inspired by Sawfish's "Matched Windows"
option and the lack of the functionality in Metacity. Metacity lacking
window matching is not a bad thing -- Metacity is a lean window
manager, and window manipulation does not have to be a window manager
task.

Devil's Pie can be configured to detect windows as they are created,
and match the window to a set of rules. If the window matches the
rules, it can perform a series of actions on that window. For example,
I make all windows created by X-Chat appear on all workspaces, and the
main Gkrellm1 window does not appear in the pager or task list.
