The Quick Lounge applet is an applet for the GNOME Panel. Applets are little
applications embedded in the Panel. With this applet you can organize your
preferred applications in a single place. You can add spaces between
applications, they can be used to group together applications with similar 
tasks. When the applet size exceeds the available space a menu containing the 
remaing launchers is created. The menu can be accessed pressing the arrow 
button located at the end of the applet. The menu displays spaces as separators.
