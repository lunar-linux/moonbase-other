  Led_applet is a gnome2 applet, that shows the status of the CAPS-,
  NUM- and SCROLL-Lock keys of your keyboard. This isn't especially
  usefull for normal keyboards, as they got leds for that. But some
  keyboards (especially wireless keyboards) don't have. One more feature
  of the applet is that it saves the status of the lock-keys and
  restores it, when starting gnome2.
