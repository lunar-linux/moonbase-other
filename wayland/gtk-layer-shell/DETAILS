           SHORT="A Wayland library for using the Layer Shell protocol"

cat << EOF
A library to write GTK applications that use Layer Shell.
Layer Shell is a Wayland protocol for desktop shell components, such as panels,
notifications and wallpapers. You can use it to anchor your windows to a corner
or edge of the output, or stretch them across the entire output. This library
only makes sense on Wayland compositors that support Layer Shell, and will not
work on X11. It supports all Layer Shell features including popups and popovers.
