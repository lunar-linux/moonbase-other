cat << EOF
Wayland is a protocol for a compositor to talk to its clients as well as a C
library implementation of that protocol. The compositor can be a standalone
display server running on Linux kernel modesetting and evdev input devices,
an X application, or a wayland client itself. The clients can be traditional
applications, X servers (rootless or fullscreen) or other display servers.
