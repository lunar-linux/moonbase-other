cat << EOF
dwl is a compact, hackable compositor for Wayland based on wlroots.
It is intended to fill the same space in the Wayland world that dwm does in X11,
primarily in terms of philosophy, and secondarily in terms of functionality.
Like dwm, dwl is:
 - Easy to understand, hack on, and extend with patches
 - One C source file (or a very small number) configurable via config.h
 - Limited to 2000 SLOC to promote hackability
 - Tied to as few external dependencies as possible
 - dwl is not meant to provide every feature under the sun. Instead, like dwm,
   it sticks to features which are necessary, simple, and straightforward to
   implement given the base on which it is built.
Implemented default features are:
 - Any features provided by dwm/Xlib: simple window borders, tags, keybindings,
   client rules, mouse move/resize. The built-in status bar is an exception to
   avoid taking a dependency on FreeType or Pango and increasing the SLOC.
 - Configurable multi-monitor layout support, including position and rotation.
 - Configurable HiDPI/multi-DPI support.
 - Various Wayland protocols.
 - XWayland support as provided by wlroots.
 - Zero flickering. Wayland users naturally expect that "every frame is perfect"
