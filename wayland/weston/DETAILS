cat << EOF
Weston is a reference implementation of a Wayland compositor. Weston can run as
an X client or under Linux KMS and ships with a few demo clients.
The Weston compositor is a minimal and fast compositor and is suitable for many
embedded and mobile use cases.
Weston has various backends that lets it run on Linux kernel modesetting and
evdev input as well as under X11. Weston ships with a few example clients, from
simple clients that demonstrate certain aspects of the protocol to more complete
clients and a simplistic toolkit. There is also a quite capable terminal
emulator (weston-terminal) and an toy/example desktop shell.
Finally, weston also provides integration with the Xorg server and can pull X
clients into the Wayland desktop and act as a X window manager.
