rpCalc started out as a little program written to try out various Python GUI
toolkits. But I ended up using it all the time (it's much quicker to pull it up
than to pull an actual HP calculator out of the desk), and I made several
improvements. So I decided to make it available to others who also like RPN
calculators.
