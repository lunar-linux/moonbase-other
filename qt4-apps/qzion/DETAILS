cat << EOF
QZion is a canvas abstraction used by and made for QEdje. As it is an
abstraction, different implementations can exist, making it possible to
optimize QEdje for different platforms/devices.

Currently an implementation, based on KGameCanvas (from libkdegames)
exists, but work is being done on providing an implementation using QT's
QGraphicsView.

The KGameCanvas-based implementation is very lightweight and works relatively
well on embedded devices, where QGraphicsView is currently slow and not
yet optimized for.
