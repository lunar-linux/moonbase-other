cat << EOF
Qedje is a declarative language that simplifies the development of complex
interfaces separating the UI design from the application logic, by providing
animations, layouts and simple scripts in a very small memory footprint.

The original Edje is part of the EFL (Enlightenment Foundation Libraries) and
according to the original creator: "Edje is an attempt to find a middleground
between theming and programming without turning the theme itself into just yet
another program", Carsten "Rasterman" Haitzler.

The main purpose of the QEdje project is to build a bridge among components that
proved to have great value for open source developers: Edje and Qt. This will
extend the Qt toolkit with the flexibility of a declarative language, such as
Edje, and also enable Qt widgets to be embedded into Edje UI design.

QZion is an canvas abstraction used by and made for QEdje. As it is an
abstraction, different implementations can exist, making it possible to optimize
QEdje for different platforms/devices.

Currently an implementation, based on KGameCanvas (from libkdegames) exists, but
work is being done on providing an implementation using QT's QGraphicsView.
