cat << EOF
This is a library for Qt-based Telepathy clients. This library adds support for some DRAFT
interfaces that could not land in TelepathyQt4 itself due to API/ABI stability rules.
Once the interfaces are final and the implementation is ready, the code will move to TelepathyQt4
itself and removed from here.
