KeePassX is an application for people with extremly high demands on secure personal data management.
It has a light interface and is cross platform. KeePassX saves many different information e.g.
user names, passwords, urls, attachments and comments in one single database.
For a better management user-defined titles and icons can be specified for each single entry.
Furthermore the entries are sorted in groups, which are customizable as well.
The integrated search function allows to search in a single group or the complete database.
KeePassX offers a little utility for secure password generation.
The password generator is very customizable, fast and easy to use.
Especially someone who generates passwords frequently will appreciate this feature.
The complete database is always encrypted either with AES (alias Rijndael) or Twofish encryption algorithm using a 256 bit key.
Therefore the saved information can be considered as quite safe.
KeePassX uses a database format that is compatible with KeePass Password Safe.
This makes the use of that application even more favourable.
