The Tapioca project provides a set of convenience libraries to easily integrate
VoIP and IM in your application, or even write new ones.

Tapioca follows the standard defined by the Telepathy project and therefore, 
operates seamlessly with its connection managers and other software that follows
it as well.

With Tapioca you can connect to SIP, Jabber, MSN, IRC and other connection 
managers that are compliant with the Telepathy specification. Integrate VoIP and 
IM in your application using your favorite programming language with just a few 
lines of code, and without having to concern about protocol implementations.

Tapioca provides convenience libraries for Glib, Qt, C# and Python, for 
client-side application development.
