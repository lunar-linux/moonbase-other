The Tapioca project provides a set of convenience libraries to easily integrate
VoIP and IM in your application, or even write new ones.

Tapioca follows the standard defined by the Telepathy project and therefore,
operates seamlessly with its connection managers and other software that follows
it as well.

With Tapioca you can connect to SIP, Jabber, MSN, IRC and other connection
managers that are compliant with the Telepathy specification. Integrate VoIP and
IM in your application using your favorite programming language with just a few
lines of code, and without having to concern about protocol implementations.

Tapioca provides convenience libraries for Glib, Qt, C# and Python, for
client-side application development.
