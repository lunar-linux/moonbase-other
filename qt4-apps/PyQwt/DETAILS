PyQwt is a set of Python bindings for the Qwt C++ class library which extends
the Qt framework with widgets for scientific and engineering applications. It
provides a widget to plot 2-dimensional data and various widgets to display and
control bounded or unbounded floating point values.

PyQwt addresses the problem of integrating PyQt, Qt, Qwt, NumPy and optionally
SciPy. Look at the Command Line Interface (CLI) examples and the Graphical User
Interface (GUI) examples to get an idea of what you can do with PyQwt.

It is highly recommended to use PyQwt with NumPy. NumPy extends the Python
language with new data types to turn Python into an ideal language for
numerical computing and experimentation.
