LyX is an advanced open source document processor that encourages an
approach to writing based on the structure of your documents, not their
appearance. LyX lets you concentrate on writing, leaving details of
visual layout to the software.
LyX produces high quality, professional output using LaTeX, an
industrial strength typesetting engine, in the background; LyX is far
more than a front-end to LaTeX, however. No knowledge of LaTeX is
necessary to use LyX, although it will give a user more power.
