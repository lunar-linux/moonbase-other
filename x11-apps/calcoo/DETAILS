Calcoo is a scientific calculator designed to provide maximum usability. The 
features that make Calcoo better than (at least some) other calculator 
programs are:

 * Bitmapped button labels and display digits to improve readability.
 * No double-function buttons - you need to click only one button for any 
   operation (except for arc-hyp trigonometric functions)
 * Undo/redo buttons.
 * Both RPN (reverse Polish notation) and algebraic modes.
 * Copy/paste interaction with X clipboard.
 * Display tick marks to separate thousands.
 * Two memory registers with displays.
 * Displays for Y, Z, and T registers.
 * It is a purely scientific calculator. There are no buttons for the 
   hexadecimal digits (ABCDEF) and logical operations, which take space and 
   distract from "scientific" buttons.
