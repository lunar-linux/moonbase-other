iDesk gives users of minimal wm's (fluxbox, blackbox, openbox,
windowmaker...) icons on their desktop. The icon graphics are
either from a png or svg (vector) file and support some eyecandy
effects like transparency. Each icon can be configured to run one
or more shell commands and the actions which run those commands
are completely configurable. In a nutshell if you want icons on
your desktop and you don't have or don't want KDE or Gnome doing
it, you can use iDesk.
