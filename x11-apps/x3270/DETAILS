cat << EOF
x3270 is an IBM 3270 terminal emulator for the X Window System. (If you
don't know what an IBM 3270 terminal emulator is, then you probably don't
need x3270). x3270 runs over a TELNET connection (with or without TN3270E)
and emulates either an IBM 3279 (color) or 3278 (monochrome).  It supports
APL2 characters, IND$FILE file transfer, NVT mode, a pop-up keypad for
3270-specific keys, a scrollbar, and has extensive debugging and scripting
facilities. It also has a novel "active icon" mode that updates the icon
image as the screen image changes, and even does a fair job of emulating a
color xterm. It does not yet support graphics.
