EFS is a system for transparent file-transfer between remote VMS,
CMS, MTS, MVS, Twenex, Explorer (the last two are Lisp machines),
TOPS-20, DOS (running the Distinct, Novell, FTP software, NCSA,
Microsoft in both unix and DOS mode, Super TCP, and Hellsoft FTP
servers), Windows NT (running the Microsoft or Hummingbird ftp
servers), Unix descriptive listings (dl), KA9Q, OS/2 hosts using FTP.
This means that you can edit, copy and otherwise manipulate files on
any machine you have access to from within Emacs as if it were a
local file.  EFS works by introducing an extended filename syntax, and
overloading functions such as insert-file-contents so that
accessing a remote file causes appropriate commands to be sent to an FTP
process.  EFS includes and enhanced version of Dired to facilitate
directory browsing and multiple file transfer from remote hosts.
