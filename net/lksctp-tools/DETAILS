cat << EOF
Stream Control Transmission Protocol (SCTP) is a message oriented, reliable
transport protocol with direct support for multihoming that runs on top of
Internet Protocol (IPv4/IPv6). Like TCP, SCTP provides reliable,
connection-oriented data delivery with congestion control, path MTU discovery
and message fragmentation. Unlike TCP, SCTP also provides:
  1. Message framing
  2. Multi-streaming (to eliminate the head-of-line blocking problem)
  3. Multi-homing (allows a single SCTP association to run across multiple
     links or paths)
  4. Security and authentication (security cookie mechanism to prevent the
  SYN-flood attacks)
  5. Ordered and unordered message delivery
The lksctp-tools project provides a Linux user space library for SCTP
(libsctp) including C language header files (netinet/sctp.h) for accessing
SCTP specific application programming interfaces not provided by the standard
sockets, and also some helper utilities around SCTP.
