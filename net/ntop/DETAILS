ntop is a network traffic probe that shows the network usage, similar
to what the popular top Unix command does.  ntop is based on libpcap
and it has been written in a portable way in order to virtually run on
every Unix platform and on Win32 as well.

ntop users can use a web browser to navigate through ntop (that acts as
a web server) traffic information and get a dump of the network status.
In the latter case, ntop can be seen as a simple RMON-like agent with
an embedded web interface.
