cat << EOF
memcached is a high-performance, distributed memory
object caching system, generic in nature, but intended
for use in speeding up dynamic web applications by
alleviating database load.
It uses libevent to scale to any number of open connections
(using epoll on Linux, if available at runtime), uses
non-blocking network I/O, refcounts internal objects
(so objects can be in multiple states to multiple clients),
and uses its own slab allocator and hash table so virtual
memory never gets externally fragmented and allocations are
guaranteed O(1).
