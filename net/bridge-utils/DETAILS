cat << EOF
A Linux bridge is more powerful than a pure hardware bridge because it 
can also filter and shape traffic. A bridge transparently relays traffic 
between multiple network interfaces. In plain English this means that 
a bridge connects two or more physical Ethernets together to form one 
bigger (logical) Ethernet.
