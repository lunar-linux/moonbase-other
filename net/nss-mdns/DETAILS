cat << EOF
nss-mdns is a plugin for the GNU Name Service Switch (NSS) functionality of
the GNU C Library (glibc) providing host name resolution via Multicast DNS
(aka Zeroconf, aka Apple Rendezvous, aka Apple Bonjour), effectively
allowing name resolution by common Unix/Linux programs in the ad-hoc mDNS
domain .local.

nss-mdns provides client functionality only, which means that you have to run
a mDNS responder daemon seperately from nss-mdns if you want to register the
local host name via mDNS. I recommend Avahi.

nss-mdns is very lightweight (9 KByte stripped binary .so compiled with
-DNDEBUG=1 -Os on i386, gcc 4.0), has no dependencies besides the glibc and
requires only minimal configuration.

By default nss-mdns tries to contact a running avahi-daemon for resolving host
names and addresses and making use of its superior record cacheing. Optionally
nss-mdns can be compiled with a mini mDNS stack that can be used to resolve
host names without a local Avahi installation. Both Avahi support and this mini
mDNS stack are optional, however at least one of them needs to be enabled. If
both are enabled a connection to Avahi is tried first, and if that fails the
mini mDNS stack is used
