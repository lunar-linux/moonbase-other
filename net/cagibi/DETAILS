cat << EOF
Cagibi aims to be to SSDP what Avahi is to DNS-SD/Zeroconf:
a cache caching all service/device announcements on the network in a local
process as well as being a broker serving local announcements to the network.
Both should be done by a single daemon process, accessable via D-Bus on the
system bus.
