cat << EOF
The Internet Software Consortium DHCP distribution includes a DHCP
client, a DHCP server, and a DHCP relay agent. DHCP is a protocol for
automatically configuring nodes on an IP network. The ISC DHCP server
and client are well known for being extremely configurable, reasonably
easy to use, and quite efficient.
