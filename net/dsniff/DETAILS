cat << EOF
dsniff is a collection of tools for network auditing and penetration
testing. dsniff, filesnarf, mailsnarf, msgsnarf, urlsnarf, and webspy
passively monitor a network for interesting data (passwords, e-mail,
files, etc.). arpspoof, dnsspoof, and macof facilitate the interception of
network traffic normally unavailable to an attacker (e.g, due to layer-2
switching). sshmitm and webmitm implement active monkey-in-the-middle
attacks against redirected SSH and HTTPS sessions by exploiting weak
bindings in ad-hoc PKI.
