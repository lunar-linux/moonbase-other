cat << EOF
Netatalk is a freely-available, kernel level implementation of the
AppleTalk Protocol Suite, originally for BSD-derived systems. A
*NIX/*BSD system running netatalk is capable of serving many macintosh
clients simultaneously as an AppleTalk router, AppleShare file server,
*NIX/*BSD print server, and for accessing AppleTalk printers via Printer
Access Protocol (PAP). Included are a number of minor printing and
debugging utilities.
