cat << EOF
Nomad is a network mapping program designed to automatically discover a local
network, using SNMP to identify network devices and work out how they are
physically connected together. The network is then presented as a topology
diagram with simple integrated monitoring. Changes in the network are
reflected in the diagram which continuously updates, and you can customise
your own views of the network map with various views and filters. At least
that's what's supposed to happen. Nomad is released under the GNU General
Public License.
