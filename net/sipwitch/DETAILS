GNU Telephony is a meta project to enable anyone to use free as in freedom 
software for telephony, and with the freedom to do so on any platform they 
choose to use. We also wish to make it easy to use the Internet for real-time
voice and video communication, and in fact for all forms of real-time 
collaboration.
