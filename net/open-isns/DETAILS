cat << EOF
This is a partial implementation of iSNS, according to RFC4171.
The implementation is still somewhat incomplete and it comprises:

isnsd
 	This is the iSNS server, supporting persistent storage
	of registrations in a file based database.

 isnsadm
 	A command line utility for querying the iSNS database,
	and for registering/deregistering nodes and portals

 isnsdd
 	An iSNS Discovery Daemon, which is still very much work
	in progress. The daemon is supposed to handle all the
	bit banging and server communications required to register
	a node, its portals, and to maintain the registration.
	It is also supposed to use the iSNS State Change Notification
	framework to learn of new targets or initiators coming online,
	and inform local services (such as the iSCSI initiator daemon)
	about these changes.
