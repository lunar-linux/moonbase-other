DeleGate is a multi-purpose application level gateway, or a proxy server
which runs on multiple platforms (Unix, Windows, Mac OS X, and OS/2).
DeleGate mediates communication of various protocols (HTTP, FTP, NNTP,
SMTP, POP, Telnet, SOCKS, etc.), applying cache and conversion for
mediated data, controlling access from clients and routing toward
servers. It translates protocols between clients and servers, applying
SSL(TLS) to arbitrary protocols, merging several servers into a single
server view with aliasing and filtering. Born as a tiny proxy for Gopher
in March 1994, it has steadily grown into a general purpose proxy
server. Besides proxy, DeleGate can be used as a simple origin server
for some protocols (HTTP, FTP, and NNTP).
