Netcat has been dubbed the network swiss army knife. 
It is a simple Unix utility which reads and writes data across network 
connections, using TCP or UDP protocol. It is designed to be a 
reliable "back-end" tool that can be used directly or easily driven by 
other programs and scripts. At the same time, it is a feature-rich 
network debugging and exploration tool, since it can create almost any 
kind of connection you would need and has several interesting built-in 
capabilities.
