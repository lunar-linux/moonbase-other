Socat is a command line based utility that establishes two bidirectional byte
streams and transfers data between them. Because the streams can be
constructed from a large set of different types of data sinks and sources
(see address types), and because lots of address options may be applied to the
streams, socat can be used for many different purposes. It might be one of the
tools that one has already needed.
