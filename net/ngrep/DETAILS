ngrep strives to provide most of GNU grep's common features, applying
them to the network layer. ngrep is a pcap-aware tool that will allow
you to specify extended regular or hexadecimal expressions to match
against data payloads of packets. It currently recognizes TCP, UDP, and
ICMP across Ethernet, PPP, SLIP,FDDI, Token Ring, and null interfaces,
and understands bpf filter logic in the same fashion as more common
packet sniffing tools, such as tcpdump and snoop.
