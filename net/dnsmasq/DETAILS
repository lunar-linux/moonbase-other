cat << EOF
Dnsmasq is a lightweight, easy to configure DNS forwarder and DHCP server.
It is designed to provide DNS and, optionally, DHCP, to a small network.
It can serve the names of local machines which are not in the global DNS.

Dnsmasq is targeted at home networks using NAT and connected to the
internet via a modem, cable-modem or ADSL connection but would be a
good choice for any small network where low resource use and ease of
configuration are important.
