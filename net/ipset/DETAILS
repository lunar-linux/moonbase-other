        SHORT="Administration tool for IP sets"

cat << EOF
IP sets are a framework inside the Linux kernel, which can be administered by
the ipset utility. Depending on the type, an IP set may store IP addresses,
networks, (TCP/UDP) port numbers, MAC addresses, interface names or combinations
of them in a way, which ensures lightning speed when matching an entry against
a set.
If you want to:
  - store multiple IP addresses or port numbers and match against the collection
    by iptables at one swoop;
  - dynamically update iptables rules against IP addresses or ports without
    performance penalty;
  - express complex IP address and ports based rulesets with one single iptables
    rule and benefit from the speed of IP sets then ipset may be the proper tool
    for you.
