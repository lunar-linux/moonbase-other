cat << EOF
SSH-Contact is a client/service tool that makes it easy to connect to your
telepathy IM contacts via SSH. No need to care about dynamic IP, NAT, port
forwarding, or firewalls anymore; if you can chat with a friend, you can
also SSH to their machine.

Only contacts with ssh-contact service installed and connected using
telepathy are listed.

If you install the ssh-contact service, your ssh daemon is exposed to all your
IM contacts. Of course they still have to make the ssh authentication
(password, ssh key, etc). This means that your sshd is not "protected" anymore
behind a NAT or firewall.

It is equivalent to have ssh daemon running with a public IP address and port
22 open. So ssh-contact-service security == sshd security. It is your choice
to trust sshd or not.
