SSH-Contact is a client/service tool that makes it easy to connect to your 
telepathy IM contacts via SSH. No need to care about dynamic IP, NAT, port 
forwarding, or firewalls anymore; if you can chat with a friend, you can 
also SSH to their machine.

Only contacts with ssh-contact service installed and connected using 
telepathy are listed.

If you install the ssh-contact service, your ssh daemon is exposed to all your 
IM contacts. Of course they still have to make the ssh authentication 
(password, ssh key, etc). This means that your sshd is not "protected" anymore
behind a NAT or firewall. 

It is equivalent to have ssh daemon running with a public IP address and port 
22 open. So ssh-contact-service security == sshd security. It is your choice 
to trust sshd or not.
