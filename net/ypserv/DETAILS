The Network Information Service (NIS) provides a simple network lookup service 
consisting of databases and processes. It was formerly known as Sun Yellow 
Pages (YP). The functionality of the two remains the same, only the name has 
changed. Its purpose is to provide information, that has to be known throughout 
the network, to all machines on the network.
