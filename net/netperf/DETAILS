Netperf is a benchmark that can be used to measure the performance
of many different types of networking. It provides tests for both
unidirecitonal throughput, and end-to-end latency. The environments
currently measureable by netperf include:
  * TCP and UDP via BSD Sockets for both IPv4 and IPv6
  * DLPI
  * Unix Domain Sockets
  * SCTP for both IPv4 and IPv6
