cat << EOF
The ebtables program is a filtering tool for a Linux-based bridging
firewall. It enables transparent filtering of network traffic passing
through a Linux bridge. The filtering possibilities are limited to link
layer filtering and some basic filtering on higher network layers.
Advanced logging, MAC DNAT/SNAT and brouter facilities are also
included.
