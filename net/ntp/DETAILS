cat << EOF
NTP (Network Time Protocol) tries to keep servers in sync Very
useful with GPS timesources, but typically used in a third level
setup to your ISP (Which typically syncs to a first level timesource)
Several methods, use "ntpd -g -q ntp.server.dom" in a crontab (or
after connecting), or create /etc/ntp.conf and start "ntpd -g" The -g
is needed to enable a big step, otherwise it takes too long to sync.

Note: issue the "ntpd -g" command ASAP after the network is
initialized, and check out ntp-wait to not have it take too long
to sync in why other server's starts (and their logs get bad).
It's fastest slew rate is 0.5ms/sec, ie. 2000 secs to fix a second.
