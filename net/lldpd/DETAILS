LLDP (Link Layer Discovery Protocol) is an industry standard protocol designed
to supplant proprietary Link-Layer protocols such as Extreme's EDP (Extreme
Discovery Protocol) and CDP (Cisco Discovery Protocol). The goal of LLDP is to
provide an inter-vendor compatible mechanism to deliver Link-Layer
notifications to adjacent network devices.

lldpd is a lldp daemon for GNU/Linux and implements both reception and sending.
It supports both LLDP and LLDP-MED (contributed by Michael Hanig). It also
implements an SNMP subagent for net-snmp to get local and remote LLDP
information. The LLDP MIB is partially implemented but the most useful tables
are here.
