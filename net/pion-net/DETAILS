cat << EOF
There are a wide variety of open source HTTP servers available, from fast and
lightweight servers such as lighttpd, to full-featured platforms like Apache
HTTPD. The motivation of pion-net is not to implement yet another web server,
but to provide HTTP(S) functionality to new or existing C++ applications. If
you're looking for a full-featured server application, we suggest that you use
one of the projects above. If you're working on a Boost C++ application and
would just like to use HTTP to provide a simple user interface or interact with
run-time data, then pion-net is a much cleaner and simpler solution.

Pion Network Library uses the Boost and asio libraries for multi-threading and
asynchronous I/O. Multi-threading allows the use of multiple CPUs or processing
cores to process HTTP requests simultaneously. Asynchronous I/O allows each
thread to handle many connections simultaneously (otherwise, a single thread
would be required for every connection to the server). The combination of these
technologies takes full advantage of the most modern CPUs, and allows servers
implemented using pion-net to handle many thousands of connections
simultaneously with a single physical server.
