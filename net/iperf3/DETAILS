cat << EOF
Iperf is a tool for active measurements of the maximum achievable bandwidth on
IP networks.
It supports tuning of various parameters related to timing, protocols, and
buffers. For each test it reports the bandwidth, loss, and other parameters.
While tools to measure network performance, such as ttcp, exist, most are very
old and have confusing options. Iperf was developed as a modern alternative
for measuring TCP and UDP bandwidth performance.
