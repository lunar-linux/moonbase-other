bind-utils is not a separate package, it is a collection of the client side
programs that are included with BIND. The BIND package includes the client side
programs nslookup, dig and host. If you install BIND server, these programs will
be installed automatically. This module is for those users who don't need the
complete BIND server, but need these client side applications.
