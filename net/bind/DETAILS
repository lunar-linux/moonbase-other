ISC BIND
BIND (Berkeley Internet Name Domain) is an implementation of the Domain
Name System (DNS) protocols and provides an openly redistributable
reference implementation of the major components of the Domain Name
System, including:
    * a Domain Name System server (named)
    * a Domain Name System resolver library
    * tools for verifying the proper operation of the DNS server
The BIND DNS Server is used on the vast majority of name serving
machines on the Internet, providing a robust and stable architecture on
top of which an organization's naming architecture can be built. The
resolver library included in the BIND distribution provides the standard
APIs for translation between domain names and Internet addresses and is
intended to be linked with applications requiring name service.
