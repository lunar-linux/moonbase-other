cat << EOF
NetHogs is a small 'net top' tool. Instead of breaking the traffic down per
protocol or per subnet, like most tools do, it groups bandwidth by process.
This makes it easy to indentify programs that have gone wild and are
suddenly taking up your bandwidth.

 *  Shows TCP download- and upload-speed per process
 *  Supports both IPv4 and IPv6
 *  Supports both Ethernet and PPP
