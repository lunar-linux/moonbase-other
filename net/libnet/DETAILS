Libnet is an API to help with the construction and handling of network
packets. It provides a portable framework for low-level network packet
writing and handling. Libnet includes packet creation at the IP layer and
at the link layer as well as a host of supplementary and complementary
functionality. Libnet is very handy with which to write network tools and
network test code.
