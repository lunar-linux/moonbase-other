With Microsoft turning off SMB1 feature completely on Windows 10, any Samba shares
on the local network become invisible to Windows 10 computers. That's due to the
fact that SMB1 is required for Computer Browser service to function.

Newer Windows systems can use WSD (Web Services for Devices) to discover shares
hosted on other Windows computers while Linux systems normally utilize mNDS/DNS-SD
for service discovery. Microsoft is moving to support mDNS/DNS-SD, but not yet there.
