cat << EOF
The udhcp server/client is targeted deliberately at embedded
environments... Other linux DHCP servers out there (such as the ISC
DHCP server) are targeted at larger systems such as PCs (with more RAM/disk
space/etc.). As a result, the udhcp package does not have as large a
feature set as some of these DHCP packages.

Compiled against uClibc, both the server and client binaries are around
18k and when compiled as one combined binary, has a size of 28k. udhcp
is a perfect fit for embedded systems requring DHCP capabilities.

The udhcp server lease file is in binary format making the additional
storage space required for IP and MAC addresses minimal. It also has the
option of storing lease times in absolute form, or relative form, for
systems without a clock. The lease file can also be saved periodically
or by using a signal for systems with flash memory.

The client accepts all options on the command line, and calls external
scripts to handle the configuration of interfaces to allow for the
ultimate flexibility.
