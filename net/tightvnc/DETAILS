TightVNC is a VNC distribution with many new features, improvements, 
and bugfixes over VNC. It is optimized for faster operation on slow 
network links such as modem connections, provides more configuration 
options in the server, features automatic SSH tunneling in the Unix 
vncviewer, and more. The modified servers and viewers are fully 
compatible with the original VNC software.
