iplog is a TCP/IP traffic logger.  Currently, it is capable of logging TCP,
UDP and ICMP traffic.  Adding support for other protocols should be
relatively easy.

iplog's capabilities include the ability to detect TCP port scans, TCP null
scans, FIN scans, UDP and ICMP "smurf" attacks, bogus TCP flags (used by
scanners to detect the operating system in use), TCP SYN scans, TCP "Xmas"
scans, ICMP ping floods, UDP scans, and IP fragment attacks.

iplog is able to run in promiscuous mode and monitor traffic to all hosts on
a network.

iplog uses libpcap to read data from the network and can be ported to any
system that supports pthreads and on which libpcap will function.
