cat << EOF
With this thing compiled into your kernel, Linux can use a remote
server as one of its block devices. Every time the client computer
wants to read /dev/nd0, it will send a request to the server via TCP,
which will reply with the data requested. This can be used for stations
with low disk space (or even diskless - if you boot from floppy) to
borrow disk space from other computers. Unlike NFS, it is possible to
put any file system on it. But (also unlike NFS), if someone has mounted
NBD read/write, you must assure that no one else will have it mounted.
