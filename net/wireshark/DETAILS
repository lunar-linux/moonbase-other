Ethereal^UWireshark is a free network protocol analyzer for Unix and
Windows.  It allows you to examine data from a live network or from a
capture file on disk.  You  can interactively browse the capture data,
viewing summary and detail information for each packet.  Wireshark has
several powerful features, including a rich display filter language
and the ability to view the reconstructed stream of a TCP session.
