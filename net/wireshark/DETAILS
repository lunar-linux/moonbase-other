Wireshark is a free network protocol analyzer for Unix and Windows. 
It allows you to examine data from a live network or from a capture 
file on disk. You can interactively browse the capture data, viewing 
summary and detail information for each packet. Wireshark has 
several powerful features, including a rich display filter language
and the ability to view the reconstructed stream of a TCP session.
