bind-utils is not a separate package, it is a collection of the
client side programs that are included with BIND. The BIND package
includes the client side programs nslookup, dig and host. If you
install BIND server, these programs will be installed automatically.
This module is for those users who don't need the complete BIND
server, but need these client side applications.
