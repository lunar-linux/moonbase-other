The Linux Connection Manager project provides a daemon for managing
Internet connections within embedded devices running the Linux
operating system. The Connection Manager is designed to be slim and to
use as few resources as possible, so it can be easily integrated in
other Moblin-based embedded systems. It is fully modular system that
can be extended through plug-ins, to support all kinds of wired or
wireless technologies. Also, configuration methods like DHCP and domain
name resolving are implemented using plug-ins. The plug-in approach
allows for easy adaption and modification for various use cases.
