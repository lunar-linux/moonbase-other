FileRunner is a simple and efficient filemanager created to ease you
from the burden of typing thousands of ls, cd, mv, rm, cp, more in a
day just to get your work done. The interface has been made as
efficient as possible to be able to compete with the speed of command 
line usage. (Since I'm a heavy command line user myself :-).
FileRunner is implemented in Tcl/Tk and a little C.
