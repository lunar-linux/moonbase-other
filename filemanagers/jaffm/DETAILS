Jaffm stands for "Just A Fucking File Manager" and is supposed to be a
lightweight file-manager for Unix.  No needless features, only usefulness.
Its direct aim is to brainwash those who use terminals as file managers.
A lot of inspiration has come from the List View in Mac OS Finder, but on top
of that it also has Unix-handy features, with more to come, as long as it's
actually useful and doesn't bloat the darn thing up.
