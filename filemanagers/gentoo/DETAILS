cat << EOF
gentoo is a modern, powerful, flexible, and utterly configurable file
manager for UNIX systems, written using the GTK+ toolkit. It aims to be
100% graphically configurable; there's no need to edit config files by
hand and then restart the application. gentoo is somewhat inspired in its
look & feel by the classic Amiga program DirectoryOpus.
