cat << EOF
ctail is a tool for operating tail(1) across large clusters of 
machines, with many log files. It relies upon existing SSH 
authentication infrastructure, rather than introducing central 
points of log collection, or other large infrastructure changes, 
which aren't easily changed in many systems.
