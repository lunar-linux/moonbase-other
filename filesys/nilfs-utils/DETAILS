cat << EOF
NILFS is a new implementation of a log-structured file system (LFS) supporting
continuous snapshotting. In addition to versioning capability of the entire
file system, users can even restore files mistakenly overwritten or destroyed
just a few seconds ago. Since NILFS can keep consistency like conventional LFS,
it achieves quick recovery after system crashes.
Refer to Documentation/filesystems/nilfs2.txt found in the kernel source.
