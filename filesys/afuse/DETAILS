cat << EOF
Afuse is an automounting file system implemented in user-space using
FUSE. Afuse currently implements the most basic functionality that can
be expected by an automounter; that is it manages a directory of
virtual directories. If one of these virtual directories is accessed
and is not already automounted, afuse will attempt to mount a filesystem
onto that directory. If the mount succeeds the requested access proceeds
as normal, otherwise it will fail with an error.
