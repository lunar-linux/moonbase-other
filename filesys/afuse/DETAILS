cat << EOF
afuse is an automounting file system implemented in user-space using FUSE.
afuse currently implements the most basic functionality that can be expected by
an automounter; that is it manages a directory of virtual directories. If one
of these virtual directories is accessed and is not already automounted, afuse
will attempt to mount a filesystem onto that directory. If the mount succeeds
the requested access proceeds as normal, otherwise it will fail with an error.
See the example below for a specific usage scenario.
The advantage of using afuse over traditional automounters is afuse runs
entirely in user-space by individual users. Thus it can take advantage of the
invoking users environment, for example allowing access to an ssh-agent for
password-less sshfs mounts, or allowing access to a graphical environment to
get user input to complete a mount such as asking for a password.
