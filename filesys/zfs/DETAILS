cat << EOF
ZFS is an advanced file system and volume manager which was originally developed
for Solaris. It has been successfully ported to FreeBSD and now there is a
functional Linux ZFS kernel port too. The port currently includes a fully
functional and stable SPA, DMU, and ZVOL with a ZFS Posix Layer (ZPL) on the
way.
