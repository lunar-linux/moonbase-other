cat << EOF
ZFS is an advanced file system and volume manager which was originally
developed for Solaris. It has been successfully ported to FreeBSD and now
there is a functional Linux ZFS kernel port too. The port currently includes
a fully functional and stable SPA, DMU, and ZVOL with a ZFS Posix Layer (ZPL)
on the way.
