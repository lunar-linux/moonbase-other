Magic Rescue scans a block device for file types it knows how to
recover and calls an external program to extract them.  It looks at
"magic bytes" in file contents, so it can be used both as an undelete
utility and for recovering a corrupted drive or partition.  As long
as the file data is there, it will find it.  It works on any file
system, but on very fragmented file systems it can only recover the
first chunk of each file.
