cat << EOF
reiserfs is a revolutionary new approach to file system design which
stores not just filenames but the files themselves in a B*-tree. It is a
generation ahead of alternatives which use older plain B-tree
technology, and cannot store the files themselves in the tree. Reiserfs
doesn't suffer from log congestion either, you can effectively use it
for quickly creating a 100,000 entry directory, and it is fairly unique
in that.
