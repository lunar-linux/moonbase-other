cat << EOF
EncFS provides an encrypted filesystem in user-space. EncFS runs without any
special permissions and uses the FUSE library and Linux kernel module to provide
the filesystem interface. You can find links to source and binary releases
below.
As with most encrypted filesystems, Encfs is meant to provide security against
off-line attacks; ie your notebook is stolen, your backups are stolen, etc. The
way Encfs works is different from the loopback encrypted filesystem support
built into the Linux kernel because it works on files at a time, not an entire
block device.
