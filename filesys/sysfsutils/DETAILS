cat << EOF
sysfsutils is a set of utilities built upon sysfs, a new virtual
filesystem in Linux kernel versions 2.5+ that exposes a system's
device tree.

sysfsutils includes the following:
 * libsysfs - The library's purpose is to provide a consistent and
              stable interface for querying system device information
              exposed through sysfs.
 * systool - A utility built upon libsysfs that lists devices by bus,
             class, and topology.
 * A number of utilities that demonstrate API usage in the "test"
   directory of the source tarball.
 * A comprehensive testsuite.
