cat << EOF
The submount system automatically mounts and unmounts removable media
devices (like cdroms and floppy disk drives) when their mount points
are accessed.  It essentially allows removable media drives to be
accessed as if they were permanently mounted.

Submount is composed of two parts:
a kernel module called "subfs"
a user program called "submountd"
