cat << EOF
The NTFS-3G driver is an open source, freely available read/write NTFS driver
for Linux, FreeBSD, OS X, and NetBSD. It provides safe and fast handling of
the Windows XP, Windows Server 2003, Windows 2000 and Windows Vista file
systems. Most POSIX file system operations are supported, with the exception
of full file ownership and access right support.

Usage:
 If there was no error during installation then the NTFS volume can be mounted
 in read-write mode for everybody as follows. Unmount the volume if it had
 already been mounted, replace /dev/hda1 and /mnt/windows, if needed
    mount -t ntfs-3g /dev/hda1 /mnt/windows

 You may also need to set the 'locale' option to make all file names with national
 characters visible. Replace the below hu_HU.utf8 with the  appropriate setting
    mount -t ntfs-3g /dev/hda1 /mnt/windows -o locale=hu_HU.utf8

 You can also make NTFS to be mounted during boot by adding the following line to 
 the end of the /etc/fstab file:
    /dev/hda1 /mnt/windows ntfs-3g defaults 0 0
