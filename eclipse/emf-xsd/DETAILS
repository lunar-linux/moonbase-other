cat << EOF
The Eclipse Modeling Framework project is a modeling framework and code
generation facility for building tools and other applications based on
a structured data model. From a model specification described in XMI,
EMF provides tools and runtime support to produce a set of Java classes
for the model, along with a set of adapter classes that enable viewing
and command-based editing of the model, and a basic editor.

EMF builds include XML Schema Definition (XSD), now a component of the
Model Development Tools (MDT) project, and an EMF-based implementation
of Service Data Objects (SDO). XSD provides a model and API for
manipulating components of an XML Schema, with access to the underlying
DOM representation of the schema document.
