cat << EOF
EMF is a modeling framework and code generation facility for building
tools and other applications based on a structured data model. From a
model specification described in XMI, EMF provides tools and runtime
support to produce a set of Java classes for the model, a set of adapter
classes that enable viewing and command-based editing of the model,
and a basic editor.
