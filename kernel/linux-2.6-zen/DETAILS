The Zen Kernel is a the result of a collaborative effort of kernel
hackers to provide the best Linux kernel possible for every day
systems. We include code that is not included in the mainline kernel
in an attempt to create an all-around better kernel for desktops
(although it can be compiled otherwise). This is done by including
new features, supporting latest hardware, and including various code
and optimizations to better suit desktops. Zen is a 100% community
oriented project so, as a result, everybody can contribute to the
project.
