NUMA stands for Non-Uniform Memory Access, in other words a system whose
memory is not all in one place. The system consists of multiple "nodes"
of cpu's (processors) and/or memory which are linked together by a
special high-speed network. All cpu's have access to all of memory, but
a cpu's access to memory on the local or a nearby node is faster than to
distant nodes.  The numactl program allows you to run your application
program on specific cpu's and memory nodes. It does this by supplying a
NUMA memory policy to the operating system before running your program.
