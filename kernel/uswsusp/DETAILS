The goal of the project is to create a tool that can handle the so
called "suspend-to-both". Suspend to both means that prior putting the
system in STR (suspend to ram) a snapshot of the running system is
taken and stored on disk (as suspend to disk); if for any reason (e.g.
battery depleted) the state store in the RAM is lost the user can
resume from the disk without loosing data.

Currenty suspend-to-ram and suspend-to-disk are handled by two
different program, s2ram and s2disk.

s2ram is a wrapper around the kernel's suspend-to-RAM mechanism
allowing the user to perform some graphics adapter manipulations from
the user land before suspending and after resuming that may help to
bring the graphics (and the entire system) back to life after the
resume. Incorporates the functionality of vbetool and radeontool as
well as some tricks of its own. Includes a list of working hardware
configurations along with the appropriate sets of operations to be
performed to resume them successfully.

s2disk is the reference implementation of the userspace software
suspend (µswsusp); it coordinates the steps necessary to suspend the
system (such as freezing the processes, preparing the swap space,
etc.) and handles image writing and reading. s2disk already supports
compression and encryption of the image and other features (e.g. a
nice progress bar, saving the image on a remote disk, playing tetris
while resuming, etc.) can be easily added.

s2both combines the funtionalities of s2ram and s2disk and it's
very useful when the battery is almost depleted. s2both write
system snapshot to the swap (just like s2disk) but then put the
machine into STR (just like s2ram). If the battery has enough power
left you can quickly resume from STR, otherwise you can still resume
from disk without loosing your work.
