You now need to do the following:

> ndiswrapper -i </path/to/inffile.inf>

Which will copy all of the files needed to /etc/ndiswrapper and create a 
config file for the card.
Once installed, run:

> ndiswrapper -l

You should see a list of installed drivers and a list of present hardware.
You can now run:

> modprobe ndiswrapper

Which will create wlan0, if the system has a card that works with the loaded 
driver.
