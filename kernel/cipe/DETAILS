           SHORT="CIPE - encrypted IP over UDP tunneling"
cat << EOF
This is an ongoing project to build encrypting IP routers.
It works by tunneling IP packets in encrypted UDP packets.
The protocol is designed to be lightweight and simple. Special
care has been taken to make this work over dynamic addresses,
NAT and SOCKS proxies.
