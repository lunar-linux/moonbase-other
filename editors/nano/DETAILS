cat << EOF
The nano project was started because of a few problems with the
wonderfully easy-to-use and friendly Pico text editor. GNU nano
features:
 
* Autoconf support.
* Truly free license (GNU GPL). 
* Goto-line# command w/o flag. 
* Case sensitive search function. 
* Interactive search and replace. 
* 2/3 - 1/8 size of Pico binary.
* Slang and ncurses support.
* Autoindent abillity.
* Displayed tab width option. 
* Regular expression search and replace. 
* Toggles for cmdline flags via Meta keys. 
* Tab completion when reading/writing files. 

The main disadvantage is lack of mailer integration, but this is also 
a strength. GNU nano aims to emulate Pico and perhaps provide extra 
functionality.
