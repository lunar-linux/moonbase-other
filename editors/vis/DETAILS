cat << EOF
Vis aims to be a modern, legacy-free, simple yet efficient editor, combining
the strengths of both vi(m) and sam.
It extends vi's modal editing with built-in support for multiple cursors/
selections and combines it with sam's structural regular expression based
command language.
A universal editor, it has decent Unicode support and should cope with
arbitrary files, including large, binary or single-line ones.
Efficient syntax highlighting is provided using Parsing Expression Grammars,
which can be conveniently expressed using Lua in the form of LPeg.
