cat << EOF
Zim is a WYSIWYG text editor written in Gtk2-Perl which aims to bring the
concept of a wiki to your desktop. Every page is saved as a text file with
wiki markup. Pages can contain links to other pages, and are saved 
automatically. Creating a new page is as easy as linking to a non-existing page.
Pages are ordered in a hierarchical structure that gives it the look and feel
of an outliner. This tool is intended to keep track of TODO lists or to serve
as a personal scratch book.
