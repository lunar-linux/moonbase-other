cat << EOF
Zim is a WYSIWYG text editor written in Gtk2-Perl, which aims to bring
the concept of a wiki to your desktop. Every page is saved as a text
file with wiki markup. Pages can contain links to other pages, and are
saved automatically. Creating a new page is as easy as linking to a
non-existing page. Pages are ordered in a hierarchical structure that
gives it the look and feel of an outliner. This tool is intended to keep
track of TODO lists, or to serve as a personal scratch book.
