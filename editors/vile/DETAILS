Vile retains the "finger-feel", if you will, of vi, while adding the
multiple buffer and muleitple window features of emacs and other editors.
It is definitely not a vi clone, in that some substantial stuff is missing,
and the screen doesn't look quite the same. The things that you tend to
type over and over probably work. Things done less frequently, like
configuring a startup file, are somewhat (or very, depending on how
ambitious you are) different. But what matters most is that one's
"muscle memory" does the right thing to the text in front of you, and
that is what vile tries to do for vi users.
