HT is a file viewer, editor, and analyser for test, binary, and
especially executable files that attempts to combine the low-level
functionality of a debugger and the usbility of an IDE.

Below is a list of supported executable formats.  Supported means that
HT will be able to correctly display and modify the executable header
and image.  Anything with "extended support" means it offers things
support above and beyond, like possibly import/export sections,
relocations, or debugging information.

  * Win32 portable executables (PE32/PE64) (extended support)
  * Unix executable and linkable format (ELF) (extended support)
  * DOS standard executables (MZ)
  * Win32 linear executables (LE) (extended support)
  * Windows/OS2 "new" executables (NE) (extended support)
  * Unix common object file format (COFF/XCOFF32)
  * Java class files (CLASS)
  * Mach exe/link format (Mach0)
  * X-Box executables (XBE) (extended support)
