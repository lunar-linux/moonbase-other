Eclipse is a kind of universal tool platform - an open extensible IDE for
anything and nothing in particular. Find out what eclipse is all about - check
out the white paper (requires Acrobat Reader 6.0 or later), read some technical
articles, visit the newsgroups, take a look at the projects, and pick up the
latest downloads. Don't forget to check out the Eclipse Project FAQ and online
documentation. You can find out about eclipse-related events, projects,
plug-ins and websites on the Community page.
