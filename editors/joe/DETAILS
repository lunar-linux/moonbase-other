Joe is a free ASCII-Text Screen Editor for UNIX.
Joe has the feel of most IBM PC text editors: The key-sequences are 
reminiscent of WordStar and Turbo-C. JOE is much more powerful than 
those editors, however. 
Joe has all of the features a UNIX user should expect: full use of 
termcap/terminfo, excellent screen update optimizations, simple 
installation, and all of the UNIX-integration features of VI.
