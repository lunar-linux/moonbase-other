WordNet® is a large lexical database of English, developed under the direction 
of George A. Miller. Nouns, verbs, adjectives and adverbs are grouped into sets
of cognitive synonyms (synsets), each expressing a distinct concept. Synsets 
are interlinked by means of conceptual-semantic and lexical relations. The 
resulting network of meaningfully related words and concepts can be navigated 
with the browser. WordNet's structure makes it a useful tool for computational 
linguistics and natural language processing.
