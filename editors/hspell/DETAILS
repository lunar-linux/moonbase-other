The Hspell project is a free Hebrew linguistic project. Its primary goal is to 
create a free Hebrew spell-checker. In addition to a spell-checker, the 
project also produced a Hebrew morphological analyzer, which for every valid 
Hebrew word lists all of its possible readings (valid combinations of prefix 
and inflected base word), and for each reading describe its part-of-speech, 
gender, tense, and other attributes.
