The Hspell project is a free Hebrew linguistic project. Its primary goal is to
create a free Hebrew spell-checker. In addition to a spell-checker, the
project also produced a Hebrew morphological analyzer, which for every valid
Hebrew word lists all of its possible readings (valid combinations of prefix
and inflected base word), and for each reading describe its part-of-speech,
gender, tense, and other attributes.
