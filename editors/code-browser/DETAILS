cat << EOF
This editor sits between a traditional text editor, a smalltalk class
browser and a web browser like mozilla. It displays a structured text
file (marker-based folding) hierarchically using multiple panes. It is
designed to keep a good overview of the code of large projects. Ideal if
you are fed up of having to scroll through thousands of lines of code.
