cat << EOF
KBarcode is a barcode and label printing application for Linux and KDE.
It can be used to print every thing from simple business cards up to complex
labels with several barcodes (e.g. article descriptions). KBarcode comes with
an easy to use WYSIWYG label designer, a setup wizard, batch import of labels
(directly from the delivery note), thousands of predefined labels, database
managment tools and translations in many languages. Even printing more than
10.000 labels in one go is no problem for KBarcode. Additionally it is a
simply xbarcode replacement for the creation of barcodes. All major types of
barcodes like EAN, UPC, CODE39 and ISBN are supported.
