Certain environment variables must be defined before compiling and using kde3 
and applications that depend on kde3, KDE_PREFIX and/or KDEDIR. 
The default values are:
   KDE_PREFIX= 
   KDEDIR=/opt/lunar/kde/3. 
You can put the file actual.rc in the /etc/profile.d directory containing the 
new value of KDE_PREFIX, and it's value will be used as the location where the 
kde3 module to be installed. KDEDIR value is used as a default value unless a 
new value is set for KDE_PREFIX. Remember to logout and login again after you
put/alter the actual.rc file, in order to be processed, and after that to 
begin the kde3 install process.
