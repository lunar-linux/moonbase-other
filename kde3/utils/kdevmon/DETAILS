cat << EOF
Kdevmon is a utility for KDE that monitors the throughput of a network device. 
It docks in Kicker (the panel of KDE 3) and shows the current network traffic 
as a diagram. There also is a resizable main window that provides a larger 
traffic diagram and displays the current net speed in bits per second. 
Middle-clicking on the dock window or on the main window offers you an overview 
of the amount of incoming/outgoing bits and the current and the maximum bit 
rate.
