        SHORT="a KDE screensaver frontend for the Linux seti@home client"

cat << EOF
The seti@home project offers two different types of clients: A client with a 
graphical GUI and a pure command line client. Unfortunately for Linux there's 
only a command client available. The command line client is quite fast compared 
to the Windows GUI version, but in my opinion WU crunching is much more fun 
when you can look on some cool graphics from time to time to really "see" what 
you are doing. Ok, this is the point where KSetiSaver kicks in: It acts as a 
normal screensaver for KDE. When it is launched it starts monitoring a 
seti@home client. KSetiSaver is also able to launch setiathome. That means 
seti@home is only active, when the screensaver is. This way you get the same 
behaviour like you would with the Windows GUI client.
