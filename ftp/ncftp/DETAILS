NcFTP Client (also known as just NcFTP) is a set of FREE application
programs implementing the File Transfer Protocol (FTP).
The program has been in service on UNIX systems since 1991 and is a 
popular alternative to the standard FTP program, /usr/bin/ftp. NcFTP
offers many ease-of-use and performance enhancements over the stock
ftp client, and runs on a wide variety of UNIX platforms as well as
operating systems such Microsoft Windows and Apple Mac OS X.
