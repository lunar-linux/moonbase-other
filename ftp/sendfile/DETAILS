Sendfile is a SAFT implementation for UNIX and serves as a tool
for asynchronous transfer of files through the Internet which
conserves file attributes. The sendfile client transfers files
to the sendfile daemon of the recipient's host. The sendfiled
takes the files, stores them in a local spool area, and informes
the recipient that files have been spooled. The recipient can
then invoke the receive client which will copy the files into
the local directory, deleting the file from the spool area.
