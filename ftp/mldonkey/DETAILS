MLDonkey is a door to the 'donkey' network, a decentralized network used 
to exchange big files on the Internet. It is written in a wonderful 
language, called Objective-Caml, and present most features of the basic 
Windows donkey client, plus some more:
 - It should work on most UNIX-compatible platforms.
 - You can remotely command your client, either by telnet, on a WEB 
   browser, or with the GTK interface. 
 - You can connect to several servers, and each search will query all the 
   connected servers.
 - You can select mp3s by bitrates in queries (useful ?).
 - You can select the name of a downloaded file before moving it to your
   incoming directory.
 - You can have several queries in the graphical user interface at the same
    time. 
 - You can remember your old queries results in the command-line interface.
 - You can search in the history of all files you have seen on the network.
