tnftp is what previously was known as lukemftp.
A port of the NetBSD FTP client to other systems, lukemftp derives its
name from the author of most of the enhanced features, which include:
command-line editing, command-line fetches of FTP and HTTP URLs
(including via proxies), command-line uploads of FTP URLs,
context-sensitive word completion, dynamic progress bar, IPv6 support,
modification time preservation, paging of local and remote files,
passive mode support (with fallback to active mode), SOCKS support,
TIS FWTK gate-ftp server support, and transfer rate throttling.
