plptools is a set of libraries and utilities for enabling Unix (mainly
Linux) systems to communicate with a Psion palmtop over a serial line.
On Linux, a connection over IrDA, using the IrCOMM feature is also
possible. A shared library encapsulates the highlevel protocol
(PsionLinkProtocol) and thus makes it easy to write applications without
extensive knowledge of the protocol itself. A daemon (ncpd) handles the
serial connection and provides it's services on a local TCP socket.
Currently, several frontends using these services are part of the package.
