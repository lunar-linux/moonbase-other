cat << EOF
Lopster is a Napster Client developed in C using the GTK user interface.
Napster is a protocol for sharing MP3 files between users.
With Napster, the files stay on the client machine, never passing
through the server. The server provides the ability to search for
particular files and initiate a direct transfer between the clients.
In addition, chat forums similar to IRC are available
