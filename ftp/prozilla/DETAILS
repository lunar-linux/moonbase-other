cat << EOF
ProZilla is a multi-threaded download accelerator for Linux which
supports both HTTP and FTP protocols. It makes multiple connections
to the server, or to different servers simultanouesly if ftpsearch is 
used, and downloads the file in portions, thus giving a much better
speed rate than the conventional download programs which use a single 
connection. Resuming connections is fully supported and customisable. 
The new FTPSearch feature enables retrieving of mirrors, and also
pings them to select the fastest server available. Both the number of 
mirrors to retrieve and the number of servers to ping at once are
fully customisable. In addition, ProzGUI, which is based on
libprozilla, features downloading from multiple servers
simultaneously based on the ftpsearch results, thus giving even
further speed increases.
