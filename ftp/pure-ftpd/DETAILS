Pure FTP Server is a fast, production quality, standards-conformant FTP server
based on Troll-FTPd. It has no known buffer overflows, is trivial to set up,
and is especially designed for modern kernels. Features include PAM support,
IPv6, chroot()ed home directories, virtual domains, built-in 'ls', FXP protocol,
anti-warez system, bandwidth throttling, bounded ports for passive downloads,
an LDAP backend, XML output, and more.

After install to create ftp virtual users database you need to add a first
user. For example:
  pure-pw useradd mike -u ftp -g ftp -d /srv/ftp/mike
  pure-pw mkdb
