What is giFT, you ask? giFT is a modular daemon capable of abstracting
the communication between the end user and specific filesharing
protocols (peer-to-peer or otherwise). The giFT project differs from
many other similar projects in that it is a distribution of a standalone
(platform-independent) daemon, a library for client/frontend development,
and our own homegrown network OpenFT.
